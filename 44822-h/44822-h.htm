    <p>
      ONSIDERING that Billy Pringle, or Fine Billy, as his good-natured friends
      called him, was only an underbred chap, he was as good an imitation of a
      Swell as ever we saw. He had all the airy dreaminess of an hereditary high
      flyer, while his big talk and off-hand manner strengthened the delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when you came to close quarters with him, and found that
      though he talked in pounds he acted in pence, and marked his fine
      dictionary words and laboured expletives, that you came to the conclusion
      that he was &ldquo;painfully gentlemanly.&rdquo; So few people, however, agree upon
      what a gentleman is, that Billy was well calculated to pass muster with
      the million. Fine shirts, fine ties, fine talk, fine trinkets, go a long
      way towards furnishing the character with many. Billy was liberal, not to
      say prodigal, in all these. The only infallible rule we know is, that the
      man who is always talking about being a gentleman never is one. Just as
      the man who is always talking about honour, morality, fine feeling, and so
      on never knows anything of these qualities but the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature had favoured Billy&rsquo;s pretensions in the lady-killing way. In person
      he was above the middle height, five feet eleven or so, slim and
      well-proportioned, with a finely-shaped head and face, fair complexion,
      light brown hair, laughing blue eyes, with long lashes, good eyebrows,
      regular pearly teeth and delicately pencilled moustache. Whiskers he did
      not aspire to. Nor did Billy abuse the gifts of Nature by disguising
      himself in any of the vulgar groomy gamekeepery style of dress, that so
      effectually reduce all mankind to the level of the labourer, nor adopt any
      of the &ldquo;loud&rdquo; patterns that have lately figured so conspicuously in our
      streets. On the contrary, he studied the quiet unobtrusive order of
      costume, and the harmony of colours, with a view of producing a perfectly
      elegant general effect. Neatly-fitting frock or dress coats, instead of
      baggy sacks, with trouser legs for sleeves, quiet-patterned vests and
      equally quiet-patterned trousers. If he could only have been easy in them
      he would have done extremely well, but there was always a nervous
      twitching, and jerking, and feeling, as if he was wondering what people
      were thinking or saying of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dress department he was ably assisted by his mother, a lady of very
      considerable taste, who not only fashioned his clothes but his mind,
      indeed we might add his person, Billy having taken after her, as they say;
      for his father, though an excellent man and warm, was rather of the
      suet-dumpling order of architecture, short, thick, and round, with a neck
      that was rather difficult to find. His name, too, was William, and some,
      the good-natured ones again of course, used to say that he might have been
      called &ldquo;Fine Billy the first,&rdquo; for under the auspices of his elegant wife
      he had assumed a certain indifference to trade; and when in the grand
      strut at Ramsgate or Broadstairs, or any of his watering-places, if
      appealed to about any of the things made or dealt in by any of the
      concerns in which he was a &ldquo;Co.,&rdquo; he used to raise his brows and shrug his
      shoulders, and say with a very deprecatory sort of air, &ldquo;&lsquo;Pon my life, I
      should say you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; or &ldquo;&lsquo;Deed I should say it was so,&rdquo; just as if he
      was one of the other Pringles,&mdash;the Pringles who have nothing to do
      with trade,&mdash;and in noways connected with Pringle &amp; Co.; Pringle
      &amp; Potts; Smith, Sharp &amp; Pringle; or any of the firms that the
      Pringles carried on under the titles of the original founders. He was
      neither a tradesman nor a gentleman. The Pringles&mdash;like the happy
      united family we meet upon wheels; the dove nestling with the gorged cat,
      and so on&mdash;all pulled well together when there was a common victim to
      plunder; and kept their hands in by what they called taking fair
      advantages of each other, that is to say, cheating each other, when there
      was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody knew the ins and outs of the Pringles. If they let their own right
      hands know what their left hands did, they took care not to let anybody
      else&rsquo;s right hand know. In multiplicity of concerns they rivalled that
      great man &ldquo;Co.,&rdquo; who the country-lad coming to London said seemed to be in
      partnership with almost everybody. The author of &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Who?&rdquo; would be
      puzzled to post people who are Brown in one place, Jones in a second, and
      Robinson in a third. Still the Pringles were &ldquo;a most respectable family,&rdquo;
       mercantile morality being too often mere matter of moonshine. The only
      member of the family who was not exactly &ldquo;legally honest,&rdquo;&mdash;legal
      honesty being much more elastic than common honesty,&mdash;was cunning
      Jerry, who thought to cover by his piety the omissions of his practice. He
      was a fawning, sanctified, smooth-spoken, plausible, plump little man, who
      seemed to be swelling with the milk of human kindness, anxious only to
      pour it out upon some deserving object. His manner was so frank and bland,
      and his front face smile so sweet, that it was cruel of his side one to
      contradict the impression and show the cunning duplicity of his nature.
      Still he smirked and smiled, and &ldquo;bless-you, dear&rdquo; and &ldquo;hope-your-happy,&rdquo;
       deared the women, that, being a bachelor, they all thought it best to put
      up with his &ldquo;mistakes,&rdquo; as he called his peculations, and sought his
      favour by frequent visits with appropriate presents to his elegant villa
      at Peckham Rye. Here he passed for quite a model man; twice to church
      every Sunday, and to the lecture in the evening, and would not profane the
      sanctity of the day by having a hot potato to eat with his cold meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a ripe rogue, and had been jointly or severally, as the lawyers
      say, in a good many little transactions that would not exactly bear
      inspection; and these &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; not tallying with the sanctified
      character he assumed, he had been obliged to wriggle out of them as best
      he could, with the loss of as few feathers as possible. At first, of
      course, he always tried the humbugging system, at which he was a great
      adept; that failing, he had recourse to bullying, at which he was not bad,
      declaring that the party complaining was an ill-natured, ill-conditioned,
      quarrelsome fellow, who merely wanted a peg to hang a grievance upon, and
      that Jerry, so far from defrauding him, had been the best friend he ever
      had in his life, and that he would put him through every court in the
      kingdom before he would be imposed upon, by him. If neither of these
      answered, and Jerry found himself pinned in a corner, he feigned madness,
      when his solicitor, Mr. Supple, appeared, and by dint of legal threats,
      and declaring that if the unmerited persecution was persisted in, it would
      infallibly consign his too sensitive client to a lunatic asylum, he
      generally contrived to get Jerry out of the scrape by some means or other
      best known to themselves. Then Jerry, of course, being clear, would
      inuendo his own version of the story as dexterously as he could, always
      taking care to avoid a collision with the party, but more than insinuating
      that he (Jerry) had been infamously used, and his well-known love of peace
      and quietness taken advantage of; and though men of the world generally
      suspect the party who is most anxious to propagate his story to be in the
      wrong, yet their number is but small compared to those who believe
      anything they are told, and who cannot put &ldquo;that and that&rdquo; together for
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Jerry went on robbing and praying and passing for a very proper man.
      Some called him &ldquo;cunning Jerry,&rdquo; to distinguish him from an uncle who was
      Jerry also; but as this name would not do for the family to adopt, he was
      generally designated by them as &ldquo;Want-nothin&rsquo;-but-what&rsquo;s-right Jerry,&rdquo;
       that being the form of words with which he generally prefaced his
      extortions. In the same way they distinguished between a fat Joe and a
      thin one, calling the thin one merely &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; and the fat one &ldquo;Joe who
      can&rsquo;t get within half a yard of the table;&rdquo; and between two clerks, each
      bearing the not uncommon name of Smith, one being called Smith, the other
      &ldquo;Head-and-shoulders Smith,&rdquo;&mdash;the latter, of course, taking his title
      from his figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this outline of the Pringle family, we will proceed to draw out such
      of its members as figure more conspicuously in our story.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Mrs. William Pringle&rsquo;s (<i>née</i> Willing) birth, parentage, and
      education, we would gladly furnish the readers of this work with some
      information, but, unfortunately, it does not lie in our power so to do,
      for the simple reason, that we do not know anything. We first find her
      located at that eminent Court milliner and dressmaker&rsquo;s, Madame Adelaide
      Banboxeney, in Furbelow Street, Berkeley Square, where her elegant
      manners, and obliging disposition, to say nothing of her taste in
      torturing ribbons and wreaths, and her talent for making plain girls into
      pretty ones, earned for her a very distinguished reputation. She soon
      became first-hand, or trier-on, and unfortunately, was afterwards tempted
      into setting-up for herself, when she soon found, that though fine ladies
      like to be cheated, it must be done in style, and by some one, if not with
      a carriage, at all events with a name; and that a bonnet, though beautiful
      in Bond Street, loses all power of attraction if it is known to come out
      of Bloomsbury. Miss Willing was, therefore, soon sold up; and Madame
      Banboxeney (whose real name was Brown, Jane Brown, wife of John Brown, who
      was a billiard-table marker, until his wife&rsquo;s fingers set him up in a
      gig), Madame Banboxeney, we say, thinking to profit by Miss Willing&rsquo;s
      misfortunes, offered her a very reduced salary to return to her situation;
      but Miss Willing having tasted the sweets of bed, a thing she very seldom
      did at Madame Banboxeney&rsquo;s, at least not during the season, stood out for
      more money; the consequence of which was, she lost that chance, and had
      the benefit of Madame&rsquo;s bad word at all the other establishments she
      afterwards applied to. In this dilemma, she resolved to turn her hand to
      lady&rsquo;s-maid-ism; and having mastered the science of hair-dressing, she
      made the rounds of the accustomed servant-shops, grocers, oilmen,
      brushmen, and so on, asking if they knew of any one wanting a perfect
      lady&rsquo;s-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      As usual in almost all the affairs of life, the first attempt was a
      failure. She got into what she thoroughly despised, an untitled family,
      where she had a great deal more to do than she liked, and was grossly &ldquo;put
      upon&rdquo; both by the master and missis. She gave the place up, because, as
      she said, &ldquo;the master would come into the missis&rsquo;s room with nothing but
      his night-shirt and spectacles on,&rdquo; but, in reality, because the missis
      had some of her things made-up for the children instead of passing them
      on, as of right they ought to have been, to her. She deeply regretted ever
      having demeaned herself by taking such a situation. Being thus out of
      place, and finding the many applications she made for other situations,
      when she gave a reference to her former one, always resulted in the ladies
      declining her services, sometimes on the plea of being already suited, or
      of another &ldquo;young person&rdquo; having applied just before her, or of her being
      too young (they never said too pretty, though one elderly lady on seeing
      her shook her head, and said she &ldquo;had sons&rdquo;); and, being tired of living
      on old tea leaves, Miss Willing resolved to sink her former place, and
      advertise as if she had just left Madame Banboxeney&rsquo;s. Accordingly she
      drew out a very specious advertisement, headed &ldquo;<i>to the nobility</i>,&rdquo;
       offering the services of a lady&rsquo;s-maid, who thoroughly understood
      millinery, dress-making, hair-dressing, and getting up fine linen, with an
      address to a cheese shop, and made an arrangement to give Madame
      Banboxeney a lift with a heavy wedding order she was busy upon, if she
      would recommend her as just fresh from her establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This advertisement produced a goodly crop of letters, and Miss Willing
      presently closed with the Honourable Mrs. Cavesson, whose husband was a
      good deal connected with the turf, enjoying that certain road to ruin
      which so many have pursued; and it says much for Miss Willing&rsquo;s acuteness,
      that though she entered Mrs. Cavesson&rsquo;s service late in the day, when all
      the preliminaries for a smash had been perfected, her fine sensibilities
      and discrimination enabled her to anticipate the coming evil, and to
      deposit her mistress&rsquo;s jewellery in a place of safety three-quarters of an
      hour before the bailiffs entered. This act of fidelity greatly enhanced
      her reputation, and as it was well known that &ldquo;poor dear Mrs. Cavesson&rdquo;
       would not be able to keep her, there were several great candidates for
      this &ldquo;treasure of a maid.&rdquo; Miss Willing had now nothing to do but pick and
      choose; and after some consideration, she selected what she called a high
      quality family, one where there was a regular assessed tax-paper
      establishment of servants, where the butler sold his lord&rsquo;s wine-custom to
      the highest bidder, and the heads of all the departments received their
      &ldquo;reglars&rdquo; upon the tradesmen&rsquo;s bills; the lady never demeaning herself by
      wearing the same gloves or ball-shoes twice, or propitiating the nurse by
      presents of raiment that was undoubtedly hers&mdash;we mean the maid&rsquo;s.
      She was a real lady, in the proper acceptation of the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the beautiful, and then newly married, Countess Delacey, whose
      exquisite garniture will still live in the recollection of many of the now
      bald-headed beaux of that period. For these delightful successes, the
      countess was mainly indebted to our hero&rsquo;s mother, Miss Willing, whose
      suggestive genius oft came to the aid of the perplexed and exhausted
      milliner. It was to the service of the Countess Delacey that Miss Willing
      was indebted for becoming the wife of Mr. Pringle, afterwards &ldquo;Fine Billy
      the first,&rdquo;&mdash;an event that deserves to be introduced in a separate
      chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.<br/>THE ROAD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was on a cold,
      damp, raw December morning, before the emancipating civilisation of
      railways, that our hero&rsquo;s father, then returning from a trading tour,
      after stamping up and down the damp flags before the Lion and Unicorn
      hotel and posting-house at Slopperton, waiting for the old True Blue
      Independent coach &ldquo;comin&rsquo; hup,&rdquo; for whose cramped inside he had booked a
      preference seat, at length found himself bundled into the straw-bottomed
      vehicle, to a very different companion to what he was accustomed to meet
      in those deplorable conveyances. Instead of a fusty old farmer, or a
      crumby basket-encumbered market-woman, he found himself opposite a
      smiling, radiant young lady, whose elegant dress and ring-bedizened hand
      proclaimed, as indeed was then generally the case with ladies, that she
      was travelling in a coach &ldquo;for the first time in her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was our fair friend, Miss Willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl and Countess Delacey had just received an invitation to spend the
      Christmas at Tiara Castle, where the countess on the previous year had
      received if not a defeat, at all events had not achieved a triumph, in the
      dressing way, over the Countess of Honiton, whose maid, Miss Criblace,
      though now bribed to secrecy with a full set of very little the worse for
      wear Chinchilla fur, had kept the fur and told the secret to Miss Willing,
      that their ladyships were to meet again. Miss Willing was now on her way
      to town, to arrange with the Countess&rsquo;s milliner for an annihilating
      series of morning and evening dresses wherewith to extinguish Lady
      Honiton, it being utterly impossible, as our fair friends will avouch, for
      any lady to appear twice in the same attire. How thankful men ought to be
      that the same rule does not prevail with them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Willing was extremely well got up; for being of nearly the same size
      as the countess, her ladyship&rsquo;s slightly-worn things passed on to her with
      scarcely a perceptible diminution of freshness, it being remarkable how,
      in even third and fourth-rate establishments, dresses that were not fit
      for the &ldquo;missus&rdquo; to be seen in come out quite new and smart on the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion Miss Willing ran entirely to the dark colours, just such
      as a lady travelling in her own carriage might be expected to wear. A
      black terry velvet bonnet with a single ostrich feather, a dark brown
      Levantine silk dress, with rich sable cuffs, muff, and boa, and a pair of
      well-fitting primrose-coloured kid gloves, which if they ever had been on
      before had not suffered by the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy&mdash;old Billy that is to say&mdash;was quite struck in a heap at
      such an unwonted apparition, and after the then usual salutations, and
      inquiries how she would like to have the window, he popped the old
      question, &ldquo;How far was she going?&rdquo; with very different feelings to what it
      was generally asked, when the traveller wished to calculate how soon he
      might hope to get rid of his <i>vis-à-vis</i> and lay up his legs on the
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To town,&rdquo; replied the lady, dimpling her pretty cheeks with a smile. &ldquo;And
      you?&rdquo; asked she, thinking to have as good as she gave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ditto,&rdquo; replied the delighted Billy, divesting himself of a great coarse
      blue and white worsted comforter, and pulling up his somewhat dejected
      gills, abandoning the idea of economising his Lincoln and Bennett by the
      substitution of an old Gregory&rsquo;s mixture coloured fur cap, with its great
      ears tied over the top, in which he had snoozed and snored through many a
      long journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Willing then drew from her richly-buckled belt a beautiful Geneva
      watch set round with pearls, (her ladyship&rsquo;s, which she was taking to town
      to have repaired), and Billy followed suit with his substantial
      gold-repeater, with which he struck the hour. Miss then ungloved the other
      hand, and passed it down her glossy brown hair, all smooth and regular,
      for she had just been scrutinising it in a pocket-mirror she had in her
      gold-embroidered reticule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy&rsquo;s commercial soul was in ecstacies, and he was fairly over head and
      ears in love before they came to the first change of horses. He had never
      seen sich a sample of a hand before, no, nor sich a face; and he felt
      quite relieved when among the multiplicity of rings he failed to discover
      that thin plain gold one that intimates so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever disadvantages old stage coaches possessed, and their name
      certainly was legion, it must be admitted that in a case of this sort
      their slowness was a recommendation. The old True Blue Independent did not
      profess to travel or trail above eight miles an hour, and this it only
      accomplished under favourable circumstances, such as light loads, good
      roads, and stout steeds, instead of the top-heavy cargo that now ploughed
      along the woolly turnpike after the weak, jaded horses, that seemed hardly
      able to keep their legs against the keen careering wind. If, under such
      circumstances, the wretched concern made the wild-beast-show looking place
      in London, called an inn, where it put up, an hour or an hour and a half
      or so after its time, it was said to be all very well, &ldquo;considering,&rdquo;&mdash;and
      this, perhaps, in a journey of sixty miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Posterity will know nothing of the misery their forefathers underwent in
      the travelling way; and whenever we hear&mdash;which we often do&mdash;unreasonable
      grumblings about the absence of trifling luxuries on railways, we are
      tempted to wish the parties consigned to a good long ride in an old stage
      coach. Why the worst third class that ever was put next the engine is
      infinitely better than the inside of the best of them used to be, to say
      nothing of the speed. As to the outsides of the old coaches, with their
      roastings, their soakings, their freezings, and their smotherings with
      dust, one cannot but feel that the establishment of railways was a
      downright prolongation of life. Then the coach refreshments, or want of
      refreshments rather; the turning out at all hours to breakfast, dine, or
      sup, just as the coach reached the house of a proprietor &ldquo;wot oss&rsquo;d it,&rdquo;
       and the cool incivility of every body about the place. Any thing was good
      enough for a coach passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this auspicious day, though Miss Willing had her reticule full of
      macaroons and sponge biscuits, and Fine Billy the first had a great
      bulging paper of sandwiches in his brown overcoat pocket, they neither of
      them felt the slightest approach to hunger, ere the lumbering vehicle,
      after a series of clumsy, would-be-dash-cutting lurches and evolutions
      over the rough inequalities of the country pavement, pulled up short at
      the arched doorway of the Salutation Inn&mdash;we beg pardon, hotel&mdash;in
      Bramfordrig, and a many-coated, brandy-faced, blear-eyed guard let in a
      whole hurricane of wind while proclaiming that they &ldquo;dined there and
      stopped half an hour.&rdquo; Then Fine Billy the first had an opportunity of
      showing his gallantry and surveying the figure of his innamorata, as he
      helped her down the perilous mud-shot iron steps of the old Independent,
      and certainly never countess descended from her carriage on a drawing-room
      day with greater elegance than Miss Willing displayed on the present
      occasion, showing a lettle circle of delicate white linen petticoat as she
      protected her clothes from the mud-begrimed wheel, and just as much fine
      open-worked stocking above the fringed top of her Adelaide boots. On
      reaching the ground, which she did with a curtsey, she gave such a sweet
      smile as emboldened our Billy to offer his arm; and amid the nudging of
      outsiders, and staring of street-loungers, and &ldquo;make way"-ing of inn
      hangers-on, our Billy strutted up the archway with all the dignity of a
      drum-major. His admiration increased as he now became sensible of the
      lady&rsquo;s height, for like all little men he was an admirer of tall women. As
      he caught a glimpse of himself in the unbecoming mirror between the drab
      and red fringed window curtains of the little back room into which they
      were ushered, he wished he had had on his new blue coat and bright
      buttons, with a buff vest, instead of the invisible green and black spot
      swansdown one in which he was then attired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outside passengers having descended from their eminences, proceeded to
      flagellate themselves into circulation, and throw off their husks, while
      Billy strutted consequentially in with the lady on his arm, and placed her
      in the seat of honour beside himself at the top of the table. The outsides
      then came swarming in, jostling the dish-bearers and seating themselves as
      they could. All seemed bent upon getting as much as they could for their
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pork was the repast. Pork in varions shapes: roast at the top, boiled at
      the bottom, sausages on one side, fry on the other; and Miss Willing
      couldn&rsquo;t eat pork, and, curious coincidence! neither could Billy. The lady
      having intimated this to Billy in the most delicate way possible, for she
      had a particular reason for not wishing to aggravate the new landlord, Mr.
      Bouncible, Billy gladly sallied forth to give battle as it were on his own
      account, and by way of impressing the household with his consequence, he
      ordered a bottle of Teneriffe as he passed the bar, and then commenced a
      furious onslaught about the food when he got into the kitchen. This
      reading of the riot act brought Bouncible from his &ldquo;Times,&rdquo; who having
      been in the profession himself took Billy for a nobleman&rsquo;s gentleman, or a
      house-steward at least&mdash;a class of men not so easily put upon as
      their masters. He therefore, after sundry regrets at the fare not being
      &lsquo;zactly to their mind, which he attributed to its being washing-day,
      offered to let them have the first turn at a very nice dish of hashed
      venison that was then simmering on the fire for Mrs. B. and himself,
      provided our travellers would have the goodness to call it hashed mutton,
      so that it might not be devoured by the outsiders, a class of people whom
      all landlords held in great contempt. To this proposition Billy readily
      assented, and returned triumphantly to the object of his adoration. He
      then slashed right and left at the roast pork, and had every plate but
      hers full by the time the hashed mutton made its appearance. He then
      culled out all the delicate tit-bits for his fair partner, and decked her
      hot plate with sweet sauce and mealy potatoes. Billy&rsquo;s turn came next, and
      amidst demands for malt liquor and the arrival of smoking tumblers of
      brown brandy and water, clatter, patter, clatter, patter, became the order
      of the day, with an occasional suspicious, not to say dissatisfied, glance
      of a pork-eating passenger at the savoury dish at the top of the table.
      Mr. Bonncible, however, brought in the Teneriffe just at the critical
      moment, when Billy having replenished both plates, the pork-eaters might
      have expected to be let in; and walked off with the dish in exchange for
      the decanter. Our friends then pledged each other in a bumper of Cape. The
      pork was followed by an extremely large strong-smelling Cheshire cheese,
      in a high wooden cradle, which in its turn was followed by an extremely
      large strong-smelling man in a mountainous many-caped greatcoat, who with
      a bob of his head and a kick out behind, intimated that paying time was
      come for him. Growls were then heard of its not being half an hour, or of
      not having had their full time, accompanied by dives into the pockets and
      reticules for the needful&mdash;each person wondering how little he could
      give without a snubbing.

    </h4>
    <p>
      Quite &ldquo;optional&rdquo; of course. Billy, who was bent on doing the magnificent,
      produced a large green-and-gold-tasseled purse, almost as big as a
      stocking, and drew therefrom a great five-shilling piece, which having
      tapped imposingly on his plate, he handed ostentatiously to the man,
      saying, &ldquo;for this lady and me,&rdquo; just as if she belonged to him; whereupon
      down went the head even with the table, with an undertoned intimation that
      Billy &ldquo;needn&rsquo;t &lsquo;urry, for he would make it all right with the guard.&rdquo; The
      waiter followed close on the heels of the coachman, drawing every body for
      half-a-crown for the dinner, besides what they had had to drink, and what
      they &ldquo;pleased for himself,&rdquo; and Billy again anticipated the lady by paying
      for both. Instead, however, of disputing his right so to do, she seemed to
      take it as a matter of course, and bent a little forward and said in a
      sort of half-whisper, though loud enough to be heard by a twinkling-eyed,
      clayey-complexioned she-outsider, sitting opposite, dressed in a
      puce-coloured cloth pelisse and a pheasant-feather bonnet, &ldquo;I fear you
      will think me very troublesome, but do you think you could manage to get
      me a finger-glass?&rdquo; twiddling her pretty taper fingers as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; replied Billy, all alacrity, &ldquo;certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a little tepid water,&rdquo; continued Miss Willing, looking imploringly
      at Billy as he rose to fulfil her behests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such airs!&rdquo; growled Pheasant-feathers to her next neighbour with an
      indignant toss of her colour-varying head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy presently appeared, bearing one of the old deep blue-patterned
      finger-glasses, with a fine damask napkin, marked with a ducal coronet&mdash;one
      of the usual perquisites of servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss then holding each pretty hand downwards, stripped her fingers of
      their rings, just as a gardener strips a stalk of currants of its fruit,
      dropping, however, a large diamond ring (belonging to her ladyship, which
      she was just airing) skilfully under the table, and for which fat Billy
      had to dive like a dog after an otter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; she was quite ashamed at her awkwardness and the trouble she
      had given, she assured Billy, as he rose red and panting from the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done on purpose to show her finery,&rdquo; muttered Pheasant-feather bonnet,
      with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss having just passed the wet end of the napkin across her cherry lips
      and pearly teeth, and dipped her fingers becomingly in the warm water, was
      restoring her manifold rings, when the shrill <i>twang, twang, twang</i>
      of the horn, with the prancing of some of the newly-harnessed cripples on
      the pavement as they tried to find their legs, sounded up the arch-way
      into the little room, and warned our travellers that they should be
      reinvesting themselves in their wraps. So declining any more Teneriffe,
      Miss Willing set the example by drawing on her pretty kid gloves, and
      rising to give the time to the rest. Up they all got.

      CHAPTER III.<br/>THE ROAD RESUMED.&mdash;MISS PHEASANT-FEATHERS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE room, as we
      said before, being crammed, and our fair friend Miss Willing taking some
      time to pass gracefully down the line of chair-backs, many of whose late
      occupants were now swinging their arms about in all the exertion of tying
      up their mouths, and fighting their ways into their over-coats, Mr.
      Pringle, as he followed, had a good opportunity of examining her exquisite
      <i>tournure</i>, than which he thought he never saw anything more
      beautifully perfect. He was quite proud when a little more width of room
      at the end of the table enabled him to squeeze past a robing, Dutch-built
      British-lace-vending pack-woman, and reclaim his fair friend, just as a
      gentleman does his partner at the end of an old country dance. How
      exultingly he marched her through the line of inn hangers-on, hostlers,
      waiters, porters, post-boys, coachmen, and insatiable Matthews-at-home of
      an inn establishment, &ldquo;Boots,&rdquo; a gentleman who will undertake all
      characters in succession for a consideration. How thankful we ought to be
      to be done with these harpies!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bouncible, either mistaking the rank of his guests, or wanting to have a
      better look at the lady, emerged from his glass-fronted den of a bar, and
      salaam&rsquo;d them up to the dirty coach, where the highly-fee&rsquo;d coachman stood
      door in hand, waiting to perform the last act of attention for his money.
      In went Billy and the beauty, or rather the beauty and Billy, bang went
      the door, the outsiders scrambled up on to their perches and shelves as
      best they could. &ldquo;<i>All right! Sit tight!</i>&rdquo; was presently heard, and
      whip, jip, crack, cut, three blind &lsquo;uns and a bolter were again bumping
      the lumbering vehicle along the cobble-stoned street, bringing no end of
      cherry cheeks and corkscrew ringlets to the windows, to mark that
      important epoch of the day, the coach passing by.

    <p>
      Billy, feeling all the better for his dinner, and inspirited by sundry
      gulps of wine, proceeded to make himself comfortable, in order to open
      fire as soon as ever the coach got off the stones. He took a rapid
      retrospect of all the various angels he had encountered, those who had
      favoured him, those who had frowned, and he was decidedly of opinion that
      he had never seen anything to compare to the fair lady before him. He was
      rich and thriving and would please himself without consulting
      Want-nothin&rsquo;-but-what&rsquo;s-right Jerry, Half-a-yard-of-the-table Joe, or any
      of them. It wasn&rsquo;t like as if they were to be in Co. with him in the lady.
      She would never come into the balance sheets. No; she was to be all his,
      and they had no business with it. He believed
      Want-nothin&rsquo;-but-what&rsquo;s-right would be glad if he never married. Just then
      the coach glid from the noisy pavement on to the comparatively speaking
      silent macadamised road, and Billy and the lady opened fire
      simultaneously, the lady about the discomforts of coach-travelling, which
      she had never tried before, and Billy about the smack of the Teneriffe,
      which he thought very earthy. He had some capital wine at home, he said,
      as everybody has. This led him to London, the street conveniences or
      inconveniences as they then were of the metropolis, which subject he plied
      for the purpose of finding out as well where the lady lived as whether her
      carriage would meet her or not; but this she skilfully parried, by asking
      Billy where he lived, and finding it was Doughty Street, Russell Square,
      she observed, as in truth it is, that it was a very airy part of the town,
      and proceeded to expatiate on the beauty of the flowers in Covent Garden,
      from whence she got to the theatres, then to the opera, intimating a very
      considerable acquaintance as well with the capital as with that enchanted
      circle, the West-end, comprising in its contracted limits what is called
      the world. Billy was puzzled. He wished she mightn&rsquo;t be a cut above him&mdash;such
      lords, such ladies, such knowledge of the court&mdash;could she be a
      maid-of-honour? Well, he didn&rsquo;t care. No ask no have, so he proceeded with
      the pumping process again. &ldquo;Did she live in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fair Lady</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Part of the year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Billy</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;During the season I &lsquo;spose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fair Lady</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;During the sitting of parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There again!&rdquo; thought Billy, feeling the expectation-funds fall ten per
      cent, at least. &ldquo;Well, faint heart never won fair lady,&rdquo; continued he to
      himself, considering how next he should sound her. She was very beautiful&mdash;what
      pretty pearly teeth she had, and such a pair of rosy lips&mdash;such a
      fair forehead too, and <i>such</i> nice hair&mdash;he&rsquo;d give a fipun note
      for a kiss!&mdash;he&rsquo;d give a tenpun note for a kiss!&mdash;dashed if he
      wouldn&rsquo;t give a fifty-pun for a kiss. Then he wondered what
      Head-and-shoulders Smith would think of her. As he didn&rsquo;t seem to be
      making much progress, however, in the information way, he now desisted
      from that consideration, and while contemplating her beauty considered how
      best he should carry on the siege. Should he declare who and what he was,
      making the best of himself of course, and ask her to be equally explicit,
      or should he beat about the bush a little longer and try to fish out what
      he could about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a good deal of day before them yet, dark though the latter part
      of it would be; which, however, on second thoughts, he felt might be
      rather favourable, inasmuch as she wouldn&rsquo;t see when he was taken aback by
      her answers. He would beat about the bush a little longer. It was very
      pleasant sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say you lived in Chelsea?&rdquo; at length asked Billy, in a stupid
      self-convicting sort of way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the fair lady with a smile; &ldquo;I never mentioned Chelsea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; no more you did,&rdquo; replied Billy, taken aback, especially as the
      lady led up to no other place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she like the country?&rdquo; at length asked he, thinking to try and fix
      her locality there, if he could not earth her in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she liked the country, at least out of the season&mdash;there was no
      place like London in the season,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy thought so too; it was the best place in summer, and the only place
      in winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the lady didn&rsquo;t know, but if she had to choose either place for a
      permanency, she would choose London.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sent the Billy funds up a little. He forgot his intention of
      following her into the country, and began to expatiate upon the luxuries
      of London, the capital fish they got, the cod and hoyster sauce (for when
      excited, he knocked his h&rsquo;s about a little), the cod and hoyster sauce,
      the turbot, the mackerel, the mullet, that woodcock of the sea, as he
      exultingly called it, thinking what a tuck-out he would have in revenge
      for his country inn abstinence. He then got upon the splendour of his own
      house in Doughty Street&mdash;the most agreeable in London. Its spacious
      entrance, its elegant stone staircase; his beautiful drawing-room, with its
      maroon and rose-coloured brocaded satin damask curtains, and rich Tournay
      carpet, its beautiful chandelier of eighteen lights, and Piccolo
      pianoforte, and was describing a most magnificent mirror&mdash;we don&rsquo;t
      know what size, but most beautiful and becoming&mdash;when the pace of the
      vehicle was sensibly felt to relax; and before they had time to speculate
      on the cause, it had come to a stand-still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stopped,&rdquo; observed Billy, lowering the window to look out for squalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the window down, than a head at the door proclaimed
      mischief. The <i>tête-à-tête</i> was at an end. The guard was going to put
      Pheasant-feather bonnet inside. Open sesame <i>&mdash;W-h-i-s-h</i>. In
      came the cutting wind&mdash;oh dear what a day!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Rum for a leddy?&rdquo; asked the guard, raising a great half-frozen,
      grog-blossomy face out of the blue and white coil of a shawl-cravat in
      which it was enveloped,&mdash;&ldquo;Git in&rdquo; continued he, shouldering the leddy
      up the steps, without waiting for an answer, and in popped
      Pheasant-feathers; when, slamming-to the door, he cried &ldquo;<i>right!</i>&rdquo; to
      the coachman, and on went the vehicle, leaving the enterer to settle into
      a seat by its shaking, after the manner of the omnibus cads, who seem to
      think all they have to do is to see people past the door. As it was, the
      new-comer alighted upon Billy, who cannoned her off against the opposite
      door, and then made himself as big as he could, the better to incommode
      her. Pheasant-feathers, however, having effected an entrance, seemed to
      regard herself as good as her neighbours, and forthwith proceeded to
      adjust the window to her liking, despite the eyeing and staring of Miss
      Willing. Billy was indignant at the nasty peppermint-drop-smelling woman
      intruding between the wind and his beauty, and inwardly resolved he would
      dock the guard&rsquo;s fee for his presumption in putting her there. Miss
      Willing gathered herself together as if afraid of contamination; and,
      forgetting her <i>role</i>, declared, after a jolt received in one of her
      seat-shiftings, that it was just the &ldquo;smallest coach she had ever been
      in.&rdquo; She then began to scrutinise her female companion&rsquo;s attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cottage-bonnet, made of pheasant-feathers; was there ever such a
      frightful thing seen,&mdash;all the colours of the rainbow combined,&mdash;must
      be a poacher&rsquo;s daughter, or a poulterer&rsquo;s. Paste egg-coloured ribbons;
      what a cloth pelisse,&mdash;puce colour in some parts,&mdash;bath-brick
      colour in others,&mdash;nearly drab in others,&mdash;thread-bare all over.
      Dare say she thought herself fine, with her braided waist, up to her ears.
      Her glazy gloves might be any colour&mdash;black, brown, green, gray. Then
      a qualm shot across Miss Willing&rsquo;s mind that she had seen the pelisse
      before. Yes, no, yes; she believed it was the very one she had sold to
      Mrs. Pickles&rsquo; nursery governess for eighteen shillings. So it was. She had
      stripped the fur edging off herself, and there were the marks. Who could
      the wearer be? Where could she have got it? She could not recollect ever
      having seen her unwholesome face before. And yet the little ferrety,
      white-lashed eyes settled upon her as if they knew her. Who could she be?
      What, if she had lived fellow&mdash;(we&rsquo;ll not say what)&mdash;with the
      creature somewhere. There was no knowing people out of their working
      clothes, especially when they set up to ride inside of coaches.
      Altogether, it was very unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy remarked his fair friend&rsquo;s altered mood, and rightly attributed it
      to the intrusion of the nasty woman, whose gaudy headgear the few
      flickering rays of a December sun were now lighting up, making the
      feathers, so beautiful on a bird, look, to Billy&rsquo;s mind, so ugly on a
      bonnet, at least on the bonnet that now thatched the frightful face beside
      him. Billy saw the fair lady was not accustomed to these sort of
      companions, and wished he had only had the sense to book the rest of the
      inside when the coach stopped to dine. However, it could not be helped
      now; so, having ascertained that Pheasant-feathers was going all the way
      to &ldquo;Lunnnn,&rdquo; as she called it, when the sun sunk behind its massive
      leadeen cloud, preparatory to that long reign of darkness with which
      travellers were oppressed,&mdash;for there were no oil-lamps to the roofs
      of stage-coaches,&mdash;Billy being no longer able to contemplate the
      beauties of his charmer, now changed his seat, for a little confidential
      conversation by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then, after a few comforting remarks, not very flattering to
      Pheasant-feathers&rsquo; beauty, resumed his expatiations about his splendid
      house in Doughty Street, Russell Square, omitting, of course, to mention
      that it had been fitted up to suit the taste of another lady, who had
      jilted him. He began about his dining-room, twenty-five feet by eighteen,
      with a polished steel fender, and &ldquo;pictors&rdquo; all about the walls; for, like
      many people, he fancied himself a judge of the fine arts, and, of course,
      was very frequently fleeced.
    </p>
    <p>
      This subject, however, rather hung fire, a dining-room being about the
      last room in a house that a lady cares to hear about, so she presently
      cajoled him into the more genial region of the kitchen, which, unlike
      would-be fine ladies of the present day, she was not ashamed to recognise.
      From the kitchen they proceeded to the store-room, which Billy explained
      was entered by a door at the top of the back stairs, six feet nine by two
      feet eight, covered on both sides with crimson cloth, brass moulded in
      panels and mortise latch. He then got upon the endless, but
      &ldquo;never-lady-tiring,&rdquo; subject of bed-rooms&mdash;his best bed-room, with a
      most elegant five-feet-three canopy-top, mahogany bedstead, with beautiful
      French chintz furniture, lined with pink, outer and inner valance, trimmed
      silk tassel fringe, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. And so he went maundering
      on, paving the way most elaborately to an offer, as some men are apt to
      do, instead of getting briskly to the &ldquo;ask-mamma&rdquo; point, which the ladies
      are generally anxious to have them at.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, Billy had been bowled over by a fair, or rather unfair one,
      who had appeared quite as much interested about his furniture and all his
      belongings as Miss Willing did, and who, when she got the offer, and found
      he was not nearly so well off as Jack Sanderson, declared she was never so
      surprised in her life as when Billy proposed; for though, as she politely
      said, every one who knew him must respect him, yet he had never even
      entered her head in any other light than that of an agreeable companion.
      This was Miss Amelia Titterton, afterwards Mrs. Sanderson. Another lady,
      as we said before (Miss Bowerbank), had done worse; for she had regularly
      jilted him, after putting him to no end of expense in furnishing his
      house, so that, upon the whole, Billy had cause to be cautious. A coach,
      too, with its jolts and its jerks, and its brandy-and-water stoppages, is
      but ill calculated for the delicate performance of offering, to say
      nothing of having a pair of nasty white-lashed, inquisitive-looking,
      ferrety eyes sitting opposite, with a pair of listening ears, nestling
      under the thatch of a pheasant-feather bonnet. All things considered,
      therefore, Billy may, perhaps, stand excused for his slowness, especially
      as he did not know but what he was addressing a countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the close of a scarcely dawned December day, was followed by the
      shades of night, and still the jip, jip, jipping; whip, whip, whipping;
      creak, creak, creaking of the heavy lumbering coach, was accompanied by
      Billy&rsquo;s maunderings about his noble ebony this, and splendid mahogany
      that, varied with, here and there, a judicious interpolation of an
      &ldquo;indeed,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;how beautiful,&rdquo; from Miss Willing, to show how interested
      she was in the recital; for ladies are generally good listeners, and Miss
      Willing was essentially so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;demeanour of the witness&rdquo; was lost, to be sure, in the chancery-like
      darkness that prevailed; and Billy felt it might be all blandishment, for
      nothing could be more marked or agreeable than the interest both the other
      ladies had taken in his family, furniture, and effects. Indeed, as he
      felt, they all took much the same course, for, for cool home-questioning,
      there is no man can compete with an experienced woman. They get to the
      &ldquo;What-have-you-got, and What-will-you-do&rdquo; point, before a man has settled
      upon the line of inquiry&mdash;very likely before he has got done with
      that interesting topic&mdash;the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, a sudden turn of the road revealed to our friends, who were
      sitting with their faces to the horses, the first distant curve of
      glow-worm-like lamps in the distance, and presently the great white
      invitations to &ldquo;try warren&rsquo;s,&rdquo; or &ldquo;day and martin&rsquo;s blacking,&rdquo; began to
      loom through the darkness of the dead walls of the outskirts of London.
      They were fast approaching the metropolis. The gaunt elms and leafless
      poplars presently became fewer, while castellated and sentry-box-looking
      summer-houses stood dark in the little paled-off gardens. At last the
      villas, and semi-detached villas, collapsed into one continuous gas-lit
      shop-dotted street. The shops soon became better and more frequent,&mdash;more
      ribbons and flowers, and fewer periwinkle stalls. They now got upon the
      stones. Billy&rsquo;s heart jumped into his month at the jerk, for he knew not
      how soon his charmer and he might part, and as yet he had not even
      ascertained her locality. Now or never, thought he, rising to the
      occasion, and, with difficulty of utterance, he expressed a hope that he
      might have the pleasure of seeing her &lsquo;ome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, <i>no</i>,&rdquo; replied Miss Willing, emphatically, for it was
      just the very thing she most dreaded, letting him see her reception by the
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Billy, feeling his funds fall five-and-twenty per cent.&mdash;&ldquo;Miss
      Titterton or Miss Bowerbank over again,&rdquo; thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not but that I most fully appreciate your kindness,&rdquo; whispered Miss
      Willing, in the sweetest tone possible, right into his ear, thinking by
      Billy&rsquo;s silence that her vehemence had offended him; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; continued she,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only going to the house of a friend, a long way from you, and I
      expect a servant to meet me at the Green Man in Oxford Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but let me see you to the&rdquo;&mdash;(puff, gasp)&mdash;&ldquo;Green Man,&rdquo;
       ejaculated Billy, the funds of hope rising more rapidly than his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind,&rdquo; whispered Miss Willing, &ldquo;and I feel it <i>very, very</i>
      much, but&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if your servant shouldn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; interrupted Billy, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d never find
      your way to Brompton in this nasty dense yellow fog,&rdquo; for they had now got
      into the thick of a fine fat one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I&rsquo;m not going to Brompton,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Willing, amused at
      this second bad shot of Billy&rsquo;s at her abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, wherever you are going, I shall only be too happy to escort you,&rdquo;
       replied Billy, &ldquo;I know Lunnun well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; thought Miss Willing, with a sigh. And the coach having now
      reached that elegant hostelry, the George and Blue Badger, in High
      Holborn, Miss showed her knowledge of it by intimating to Billy that that
      was the place for him to alight; so taking off her glove she tendered him
      her soft hand, which Billy grasped eagerly, still urging her to let him
      see her home, or at all events to the Green Man, in Oxford Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss, however, firmly but kindly declined his services, assuring him
      repeatedly that she appreciated his kindness, which she evinced by
      informing him that she was going to a friend&rsquo;s at No. &mdash;, Grosvenor
      Square, that she would only be in town for a couple of nights; but that if
      he <i>really</i> wished to see her again,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>really</i> wished it,&rdquo;
       she repeated with an emphasis, for she didn&rsquo;t want to be trifled with,&mdash;she
      would be happy to see him to tea at eight o&rsquo;clock on the following
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eight o&rsquo;clock!</i>&rdquo; gasped Billy. &ldquo;No. &mdash;&mdash;, Gruvenor
      Square,&rdquo; repeated he. &ldquo;I knows it&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be with you to a certainty&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      be with you to a&rdquo;&mdash;(puff)&mdash;&ldquo;certainty.&rdquo; So saying, he made a
      sandwich of her fair taper-fingered hand, and then responded to the
      inquiry of the guard, if there was any one to &ldquo;git oot there,&rdquo; by
      alighting. And he was so excited that he walked off, leaving his new silk
      umbrella and all his luggage in the coach, exclaiming, as he worked his
      way through the fog to Doughty Street, &ldquo;No.&mdash;&mdash;, Gruvenor Square&mdash;eight
      o&rsquo;clock&mdash;eight o&rsquo;clock&mdash;No.&mdash;&mdash;, Gruvenor Square&mdash;was
      there ever such a beauty!&mdash;be with her to a certainty, be with her to
      a certainty.&rdquo; Saying which, he gave an ecstatic bound, and next moment
      found himself sprawling a-top of a murder!&mdash;crying apple-woman in the
      gutter. Leaving him there to get up at his leisure, let us return to his
      late companion in the coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely was the door closed on his exit, ere a sharp shrill &ldquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t
      know me!&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know me!</i>&rdquo; sounded from under the
      pheasant-feather bonnet, and shot through Miss Willing like a thrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, no, yes; who is it?&rdquo; ejaculated she, thankful they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarey Grimes, to be sure,&rdquo; replied the voice, in a semi-tone of
      exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarah Grimes!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Willing, recollecting the veriest little
      imp of mischief that ever came about a place, the daughter of a most
      notorious poacher. &ldquo;So it is! Why, Sarah, who would ever have thought of
      seeing you grown into a great big woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo; replied Sarah; &ldquo;I used often to run
      errands for you,&rdquo; added she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; replied Miss Willing, feeling in her reticule for her purse.
      Sarah had carried certain delicate missives in the country that Miss
      Willing would now rather have forgotten, how thankful she was that the
      creature had not introduced herself when her fat friend was in the coach.
      &ldquo;What are you doing now?&rdquo; asked Miss Willing, jingling up the money at one
      end of the purse to distinguish between the gold and the silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarey explained that being now out of place (she had been recently
      dismissed from a cheesemonger&rsquo;s at Lutterworth for stealing a copper
      coal-scoop, a pound of whitening, and a pair of gold spectacles, for which
      a donkey-travelling general merchant had given her seven and sixpence),
      the guard of the coach, who was her great-uncle, had given her a lift up
      to town to try what she could do there again; and Miss Willing&rsquo;s quick
      apprehension seeing that there was some use to be made of such a
      sharp-witted thing, having selected a half-sovereign out of her purse,
      thus addressed her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sarah, I&rsquo;m glad to see you again. You are very much improved, and
      will be very good-looking. There&rsquo;s half a sovereign for you,&rdquo; handing it
      to her, &ldquo;and if you&rsquo;ll come to me at six o&rsquo;clock to-morrow evening in
      Grosvenor Square, I dare say I shall be able to look out some things that
      may be useful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanke, mum; thanke!&rdquo; exclaimed Sarey, delighted at the idea. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
      with you, you may depend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Big Ben,&rdquo; continued Miss Willing, &ldquo;who was my lord&rsquo;s own man;
      he&rsquo;s hall-porter now, ring and tell him you come for me, and he&rsquo;ll let you
      in at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, mum, certainly,&rdquo; assented Pheasant-feathers, thinking how much
      more magnificent that would be than sneaking down the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the coach having now reached the Green Man, Miss Willing alighted and
      took a coach to Grosvenor Square, leaving Miss Grimes to pursue its
      peregrinations to the end of its journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Billy Pringle having, with the aid of the &ldquo;pollis,&rdquo; appeased the
      basket-woman&rsquo;s wrath, was presently ensconced in his beautiful house in
      Doughty Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, <i>tinkle, tinkle, tinkle</i>,&mdash;down goes the curtain on this
      somewhat long chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.<br/>A GLASS COACH.&mdash;MISS WILLING (EN GRAND COSTUME)
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EXT day our friend
      Billy was buried in looking after his lost luggage and burnishing up the
      gilt bugle-horn buttons of the coat, waist-coat, and shorts of the Royal
      Epping Archers, in which he meant to figure in the evening. Having,
      through the medium of his &ldquo;Boyle,&rdquo; ascertained the rank of the owner of
      the residence where he was going to be regaled, he ordered a glass-coach&mdash;not
      a coach made of glass, juvenile readers, in which we could see a gentleman
      disparting himself like a gold-fish in a glass bowl, but a better sort of
      hackney coach with a less filthy driver, which, by a &ldquo;beautiful fiction&rdquo;
       of the times, used to be considered the hirer&rsquo;s &ldquo;private carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; in those days to drive up to a gentleman&rsquo;s door in
      a public conveyance, and doing the magnificent was very expensive: for the
      glass fiction involved a pair of gaunt raw-boned horses, which, with the
      napless-hatted drab-turned-up-with-grease-coated-coachman, left very
      little change out of a sovereign. How thankful we ought to be to railways
      and Mr. Fitzroy for being able to cut about openly at the rate of sixpence
      a mile. The first great man who drove up St. James&rsquo;s Street at high tide
      in a Hansom, deserves to have his portrait painted at the public expense,
      for he opened the door of common sense and utility.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a follow-my-leader-world it is! People all took to street cabs
      simultaneously, just as they did to walking in the Park on a Sunday when
      Count D&rsquo;Orsay set up his &ldquo;&lsquo;andsomest ombrella in de vorld,&rdquo; being no
      longer able to keep a horse. But we are getting into recent times instead
      of attending Mr. Pringle to his party. He is supposed to have ordered his
      glass phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mr. Forage, the job-master, in Lamb&rsquo;s Conduit Street, with whom our
      friend did his magnificence, &ldquo;performed funerals&rdquo; also, as his yard-doors
      indicated, and being rather &ldquo;full,&rdquo; or more properly speaking, empty, he
      acted upon the principle of all coaches being black in the dark, and sent
      a mourning one, so there was a striking contrast between the gaiety of the
      Royal Epping Archers&rsquo; uniform&mdash;pea-green coat with a blue collar,
      salmon-coloured vest and shorts&mdash;in which Mr. Pringle was attired,
      and the gravity of the vehicle that conveyed him. However, our lover was
      so intent upon taking care of his pumps, for the fog had made the flags
      both slippery and greasy, that he popped in without noticing the
      peculiarity, and his stuttering knock-knee&rsquo;d hobble-de-hoy, yclept &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo;
       having closed the door and mounted up behind, they were presently jingling
      away to the west, Billy putting up first one leg and then the other on to
      the opposite seat to admire his white-gauze-silk-encased calves by the gas
      and chemists&rsquo; windows as they passed. So he went fingering and feeling at
      his legs, and pulling and hauling at his coat,&mdash;for the Epping Archer
      uniform had got rather tight, and, moreover, had been made on the
      George-the-Fourth principle, of not being easily got into&mdash;along
      Oxford Street, through Hanover Square, and up Brook Street, to the
      spacious region that contained the object of his adoration. The coach
      presently drew up at a stately Italian-column porticoed mansion: down goes
      Paul, but before he gets half through his meditated knock, the door opens
      suddenly in his face, and he is confronted by Big Ben in the full livery,&mdash;we
      beg pardon,&mdash;uniform of the Delacey family, beetroot-coloured coat,
      with cherry-coloured vest and shorts, the whole elaborately bedizened with
      gold-lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
      The unexpected apparition, rendered more formidable by the blazing fire in
      the background, throwing a lurid light over the giant, completely deprived
      little Paul of his breath, and he stood gaping and shaking as if he
      expected the monster to address him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who may you please to want?&rdquo; at length demanded Ben, in a deep sonorous
      tone of mingled defiance and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&mdash;p&mdash;p&mdash;please, wo&mdash;wo&mdash;wo&mdash;want,&rdquo;
       stuttered little Paul, now recollecting that he had never been told who to
      ask for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, who do you wish to see?&rdquo; demanded Ben, in a clear explanatory tone,
      for though he had agreed to dress up for the occasion on the reciprocity
      principle of course&mdash;Miss Willing winking at his having two nephews
      living in the house&mdash;he by no means undertook to furnish civility to
      any of the undergraduates of life, as he called such apologies as Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll ask,&rdquo; replied Paul, glad to escape back to the
      coach, out of which the Royal Archer&rsquo;s bull-head was now protruding,
      anxious to be emancipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;ho&mdash;ho am I to a&mdash;a&mdash;ask for, pa&mdash;pa&mdash;per&mdash;please?&rdquo;
       stuttered Paul, trembling all over with fear and excitement, for he had
      never seen such a sight except in a show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask for!&rdquo; muttered Billy, now recollecting for the first time that the
      fair lady and he were mutually ignorant of each other&rsquo;s names. &ldquo;Ask for!
      What if it should be a hoax?&rdquo; thought he; &ldquo;how foolish he would look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While these thoughts were revolving in Billy&rsquo;s mind, Big Ben, having
      thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his cherry-coloured shorts, was
      contemplating the dismal-looking coach in the disdainful cock-up-nose sort
      of way that a high-life Johnny looks at what he considers a low-life
      equipage; wondering, we dare say, who was to be deceived by such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, seeing the case was desperate, resolved to put a bold face on the
      matter, especially as he remembered his person could not be seen in the
      glass coach; so, raising his crush hat to his face, he holloaed out, &ldquo;<i>I
      say! is this the Earl of Delacey&rsquo;s?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Ben, with a slight inclination of his gigantic person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, let me out,&rdquo; demanded Billy of Paul. And this request being
      complied with, Billy skipped smartly across the flags, and was presently
      alongside of Ben, whispering up into his now slightly-inclined ear, &ldquo;<i>I
      say, was there a lady arrived here last night from the country?</i>&rdquo; (He
      was going to say &ldquo;by the coach,&rdquo; but he checked himself when he got to the
      word country.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was, sir,&rdquo; replied Ben, relaxing into something like condescension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m come to see her,&rdquo; whispered Billy, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name, if you please, sir?&rdquo; replied Ben, still getting up the steam
      of politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pringle&mdash;Mr. William Pringle!&rdquo; replied Billy with firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; replied the blood-red monster, pretending to know more
      than he did; and, motioning Billy onward into the black and white
      marble-flagged entrance hall, he was about to shut him in, when Billy,
      recollecting himself, holloaed, &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Ome!</i>&rdquo; to his coachman, so that he
      mightn&rsquo;t be let in for the two days&rsquo; hire. The door then closed, and he
      was in for an adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be evident to our fair friends that the Archer bold had the
      advantage over the lady, in having all his raiment in town, while she had
      all hers, at least all the pick of hers,&mdash;her first-class things,&mdash;in
      the country. Now every body knows that what looks very smart in the
      country looks very seedy in London, and though the country cousins of life
      do get their new things to take back with them there, yet regular
      town-comers have theirs ready, or ready at all events to try on against
      they arrive, and so have the advantage of looking like civilised people
      while they are up. London, however, is one excellent place for remedying
      any little deficiency of any sort, at least if a person has only either
      money or credit, and a lady or gentleman can soon be rigged out by driving
      about to the different shops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that Miss Willing had nothing of her own in town, that
      she felt she would be doing herself justice to appear before Billy in, and
      had omitted bringing her ladyship&rsquo;s keys, whereby she might have remedied
      the deficiency out of that wardrobe; however, with such a commission as
      she held, there could be no difficulty in procuring the loan of whatever
      was wanted from her ladyship&rsquo;s milliner. We may mention that on accepting
      office under Lady Delacey, Miss Willing, with the greatest spirit of
      fairness, had put her ladyship&rsquo;s custom in competition among three
      distinguished modistes, viz. her old friend Madame Adelaide Banboxeney,
      Madame Celeste de Montmorency, of Dover Street, and Miss Julia Freemantle,
      of Cowslip Street, May Fair; and Miss Freemantle having offered the same
      percentage on the bill (£15) as the other two, and £20 a year certain
      money more than Madame Banboxeney, and £25 more than Madame Celeste de
      Montmorency, Miss Freemantle had been duly declared the purchaser, as the
      auctioneers say, and in due time (as soon as a plausible quarrel could be
      picked with the then milliner) was in the enjoyment of a very good thing,
      for though the Countess Delacey, in the Gilpin-ian spirit of the age,
      tried to tie Miss Freemantle down to price, yet she overlooked the extras,
      the little embroidery of a bill, if we may so call it, such as four pound
      seventeen and sixpence for a buckle, worth perhaps the odd silver, and the
      surreptitious lace, at no one knows what, so long as they were not all in
      one item, and were cleverly scattered about the bill in broken sums, just
      as the lady thought the ribbon dear at a shilling a yard, but took it when
      the counter-skipper replied, &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose, marm, then, we say thirteen pence&rdquo;&mdash;Miss
      Willing having had a consultation with Miss Freemantle as to the most
      certain means of quashing the Countess of Honiton, broached her own little
      requirements, and Miss Freemantle, finding that she only wanted the dress
      for one night, agreed to lend her a very rich emerald-green Genoa velvet
      evening-dress, trimmed with broad Valenciennes lace, she was on the point
      of furnishing for Alderman Boozey&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s bran-new wife; Miss Freemantle
      feeling satisfied, as she said, that Miss Willing would do it no harm;
      indeed, would rather benefit it by the sit her fine figure would give it,
      in the same way as shooters find it to their advantage to let their
      keepers have a day or two&rsquo;s wear out of their new shoes in order to get
      them to go easy for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will therefore have the goodness to consider Miss Willing
      arrayed in Alderman Boozey&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s bran-new wife&rsquo;s bran-new Genoa velvet
      dress, with a wreath of pure white camellias on her beautiful brown
      Madonna-dressed hair, and a massive true-lover&rsquo;s-knot brooch in brilliants
      at her bosom. On her right arm she wears a magnificent pearl armlet, which
      Miss Freemantle had on sale or return from that equitable
      diamond-merchant, Samuel Emanuel Moses, of the Minories, the price
      ranging, with Miss Freemantle, from eighty to two hundred and fifty
      guineas, according to the rank and paying properties of the inquirer,
      though as between Moses and &ldquo;Mantle,&rdquo; the price was to be sixty guineas,
      or perhaps pounds, depending upon the humour Moses might happen to be in,
      when she came with the dear £. s. d. The reader will further imagine an
      elegant little boudoir with its amber-coloured silk fittings and
      furniture, lit up with the united influence of the best wax and Wallsend,
      and Miss Willing sitting at an inlaid centre-table, turning over the
      leaves of Heath&rsquo;s &ldquo;Picturesque Annual&rdquo; of the preceding year. Opposite the
      fire are large white and gold folding-doors, opening we know not where,
      outside of which lurks Pheasant-feathers, placed there by Miss Willing on
      a service of delicacy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.<br/>THE LADY&rsquo;S BOUDOIR.&mdash;A DECLARATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS way, sir,&mdash;please,
      sir,&mdash;yes, sir,&rdquo; bowed the now obsequious Ben, guiding Billy by the
      light of a chamber candle through the intricacies of the half-lit inner
      entrance. &ldquo;Take care, sir, there&rsquo;s a step, sir,&rdquo; continued he, stopping
      and showing where the first stumbling-block resided. Billy then commenced
      the gradual accent of the broad, gently-rising staircase, each step
      increasing his conviction of the magnitude of the venture, and making him
      feel that his was not the biggest house in town. As he proceeded he
      wondered what Nothin&rsquo;-but-what&rsquo;s-right Jerry, or Half-a-yard-of-the-table
      Joe, above all Mrs. Half-a-yard-of-the-table, would say if they could see
      him thus visiting at a nobleman&rsquo;s house, it seemed more like summut in a
      book or a play than downright reality. Still there was no reason why a
      fine lady should not take a fancy to him&mdash;many deuced deal uglier
      fellows than he had married fine ladies, and he would take his chance
      along with the rest of them&mdash;so he laboured up after Ben, hoping he
      might not come down stairs quicker than he went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top landing being gained, they passed through lofty folding-doors into
      the suite of magnificent but now put-away drawing-rooms, whose spectral
      half collapsed canvas bags, and covered statues and sofas, threw a
      Kensal-Green-Cemetery sort of gloom over Billy&rsquo;s spirits; speedily,
      however, to be dispelled by the radiance of the boudoir into which he was
      now passed through an invisible door in the gilt-papered wall. &ldquo;Mr.
      William Pringle, ma&rsquo;m,&rdquo; whispered Ben, in a tone that one could hardly
      reconcile to the size of the monster: and Miss Willing having risen at the
      sound of the voice, bowing, Billy and she were presently locked hand in
      hand, smiling and teeth-showing most extravagantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ring for tea
      presently,&rdquo; observed she to Ben, who seemed disposed to fuss and loiter
      about the room. &ldquo;If you please, my lady,&rdquo; replied Ben, bowing himself
      backwards through the panel. Happy Billy was then left alone with his
      charmer, save that beetroot-coloured Ben was now listening at one door on
      his own account, and Pheasant-feathers at the other on Miss Willing&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was quite taken aback. If he had been captivated in the coach what
      chance had he now, with all the aid of dress, scenery, and decorations. He
      thought he had never seen such a beauty&mdash;he thought he had never seen
      such a bust&mdash;he thought he had never seen such an arm! Miss Titterton&mdash;pooh!&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t
      to be mentioned in the same century&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t half such a waist. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
      you be seated?&rdquo; at length asked Miss Willing, as Billy still stood staring
      and making a mental inventory of her charms. &ldquo;Seat&rdquo;&mdash;(puff)&mdash;&ldquo;seat&rdquo;
       (wheeze), gasped Billy, looking around at the shining amber-coloured
      magnificence by which he was surrounded, as if afraid to venture, even in
      his nice salmon-coloured shorts. At length he got squatted on a gilt chair
      by his charmer&rsquo;s side, when taking to look at his toes, she led off the
      ball of conversation. She had had enough of the billing and cooing or
      gammon and spinach of matrimony, and knew if she could not bring him to
      book at once, time would not assist her. She soon probed his family
      circle, and was glad to find there was no &ldquo;mamma&rdquo; to &ldquo;ask,&rdquo; that dread
      parent having more than once been too many for her. She took in the whole
      range of connection with the precision of an auctioneer or an equity
      draftsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no occasion for much diplomacy on her part, for Billy came into
      the trap just like a fly to a &ldquo;Ketch-&rsquo;em-alive O!&rdquo; The conversation soon
      waxed so warm that she quite forgot to ring for the tea; and Ben, who
      affected early hours in the winter, being slightly asthmatical, as a
      hall-porter ought to be, at length brought it in of his own accord. Most
      polite he was; &ldquo;My lady&rdquo; and &ldquo;Your ladyship-ing&rdquo; Miss Willing with
      accidental intention every now and then, which raised Billy&rsquo;s opinion of
      her consequence very considerably. And so he sat, and sipped and sipped,
      and thought what a beauty she would be to transfer to Doughty Street. Tea,
      in due time, was followed by the tray&mdash;Melton pie, oysters,
      sandwiches, anchovy toast, bottled stout, sherry and Seltzer water, for
      which latter there was no demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A profane medicine-chest-looking mahogany case then made its appearance,
      which, being opened, proved to contain four cut-glass spirit-bottles,
      labelled respectively, &ldquo;Rum,&rdquo; &ldquo;Brandy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Whiskey,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gin,&rdquo; though they were
      not true inscriptions, for there were two whiskey&rsquo;s and two brandy&rsquo;s. A
      good old-fashioned black-bottomed kettle having next mounted a stand
      placed on the top bar, Miss intimated to Ben that if they had a few more
      coals, he need not &ldquo;trouble to sit up;&rdquo; and these being obtained, our
      friends made a brew, and then drew their chairs together to enjoy the
      feast of reason and the flow of soul; Miss slightly raising Alderman
      Boozey&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s bran-new wife&rsquo;s bran-new emerald-green velvet dress to show
      her beautiful white-satin slippered foot, as it now rested on the polished
      steel fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The awkwardness of resuming the interrupted addresses being at length
      overcome by sundry gulphs of the inspiring fluid, our friend Mr. Pringle
      was soon in full fervour again. He anathematised the lawyers and
      settlements, and delay, and was all for being married off-hand at the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss, on her part, was dignified and prudent. All she would say was that
      Mr. William Pringle was not indifferent to her,&mdash;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; sighed she,
      &ldquo;he wasn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;but there were many, many considerations, and many, many
      points to be discussed, and many, many questions to be asked of each
      other, before they could even begin to <i>talk</i> of such a thing as
      immediate&mdash;&ldquo;hem&rdquo;&mdash;(she wouldn&rsquo;t say the word) turning away her
      pretty head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ask away, then!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, helping himself to another
      beaker of brandy&mdash;for he saw he was approaching the &ldquo;Ketch-&rsquo;em-alive
      O.&rdquo; Miss then put the home-question whether his family knew what he was
      about, and finding they did not, she saw there was no time to lose; so
      knocking off the expletives, she talked of many considerations and points,
      the main one being to know how she was likely to be kept,&mdash;whether
      she was to have a full-sized footman, or an under-sized stripling, or a
      buttony boy of a page, or be waited upon by that greatest aversion to all
      female minds, one of her own sex. Not that she had the slightest idea of
      saying &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but her experience of life teaching her that all early
      grandeur may be mastered by footmen, she could very soon calculate what
      sort of a set down she was likely to have by knowing the style of her
      attendant. &ldquo;Show me your footman, and I will tell you what you are,&rdquo; was
      one of her maxims. Moreover, it is well for all young ladies to have a
      sort of rough estimate, at all events, of what they are likely to have,&mdash;which,
      we will venture to say, unlike estimates in general, will fall very far
      short of the reality. Our friend Billy, however, was quite in the
      promising mood, and if she had asked for half-a-dozen Big Bens he would
      have promised her them, canes, powder, and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! she should have anything, everything she wanted! A tall man with good
      legs, and all right about the mouth,&mdash;an Arab horse, an Erard harp, a
      royal pianoforte, a silver tea-urn, a gold coffee-pot, a service of gold&mdash;<i>eat
      gold</i>, if she liked,&rdquo; and as he declared she might eat gold if she
      liked, he dropped upon his salmon-coloured knees, and with his glass of
      brandy in one hand, and hers in the other, looked imploringly up at her, a
      beautiful specimen of heavy sentimentality; and Miss, thinking she had got
      him far enough, and seeing it was nearly twelve o&rsquo;clock, now urged him to
      rise, and allow her maid to go and get him a coach. Saying which, she
      disengaged her hand, and slipping through the invisible door, was
      presently whispering her behests to the giggling Pheasant-feathers, on the
      other side of the folding ones. A good half-hour, however, elapsed before
      one of those drowsy vehicles could be found, during which time our suitor
      obtained the fair lady&rsquo;s consent to allow him to meet her at her friend
      Mrs. Freemantle&rsquo;s, as she called her, in Cowslip Street, May Fair, at
      three o&rsquo;clock in the following afternoon; and the coach having at length
      arrived, Miss Willing graciously allowed Mr. Pringle to kiss her hand, and
      then accompanied him to the second landing of the staircase, which
      commanded the hall, in order to check any communication between
      Pheasant-feathers and him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will now perhaps accompany us to this famed milliner, dress and
      mantle-maker&rsquo;s, who will be happy to execute any orders our fair ones may
      choose to favour her with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the anathemas of a certain law lord, match-forwarding is quite the
      natural prerogative and instinct of women. They all like it, from the
      duchess downwards, and you might as well try to restrain a cat from
      mousing as a woman from match-making. Miss Freemantle (who acted Mrs. on
      this occasion) was as fond of the pursuit as any one. She looked Billy
      over with a searching, scrutinising glance, thinking what a flat he was,
      and wondered what he would think of himself that time twelvemonths. Billy,
      on his part, was rather dumb-foundered. Talking before two women was not
      so easy as talking to one; and he did not get on with the immediate
      matrimony story half so well as he had done over-night. The ladies saw his
      dilemma, and Miss Willing quickly essayed to relieve him. She put him
      through his pleadings with all the skill of the great Serjeant
      Silvertougue, making Billy commit himself most irretrievably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma&rdquo; (Miss Freemantle that is to say) then had her innings.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was much afraid it couldn&rsquo;t be done off-hand&mdash;indeed she was.
      There was a place on the Border&mdash;Gretna Green&mdash;she dare say&rsquo;d
      he&rsquo;d heard of it; but then it was a tremendous distance, and would take
      half a lifetime to get to it. Besides, Miss p&rsquo;raps mightn&rsquo;t like taking
      such a journey at that time of year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss looked neither yes nor no. Mamma was more against it than her, Mamma
      feeling for the countess&rsquo;s coming contest and her future favours. Other
      difficulties were then discussed, particularly that of publicity, which
      Miss dreaded more than the journey to Gretna. It must be kept secret,
      whatever was done. Billy must be sworn to secrecy, or Miss would have
      nothing to say to him. Billy was sworn accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamma then thought the best plan was to have the banns put up in some
      quiet church, where no questions would be asked as to where they lived,
      and it would be assumed that they resided within the parish, and when they
      had been called out, they could just go quietly and get married, which
      would keep things square with the countess and everybody else. And this
      arrangement being perfected, and liberty given to Billy to write to his
      bride, whose name and address were now furnished him, he at length took
      his departure; and the ladies having talked him over, then resolved
      themselves into a committee of taste, to further the forthcoming
      tournament. And by dint of keeping all hands at work all night, Miss
      Willing was enabled to return to the countess with the first instalment of
      such a series of lady-killing garments as mollified her heart, and enabled
      her to sustain the blow that followed, which however was mitigated by the
      assurance that Mr. and Mrs. William Pringle were going to live in London,
      and that Madam&rsquo;s taste would always be at her ladyship&rsquo;s command.
    </p>
    <p>
      We wish we could gratify our lady readers with a description of the
      brilliant attire that so completely took the shine out of the Countess of
      Honiton as has caused her to hide her diminished head ever since, but our
      pen is unequal to the occasion, and even if we had had a John Leech to
      supply our deficiencies, the dresses of those days would look as nothing
      compared to the rotatory haystacks of the present one.
    </p>
    <p>
      What fair lady can bear the sight of her face painted in one of the old
      poke bonnets of former days? To keep things right, the bonnet ought to be
      painted to the face every year or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to the lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time &ldquo;Mamma&rdquo; (Miss Freemantle) presented her blooming daughter to
      the happy Billy, who was attended to the hymeneal alter by his
      confidential clerk, Head-and-shoulders Smith. Big Ben, who was dressed in
      a blue frock coat with a velvet collar, white kerseymere trousers, and
      varnished boots, looking very like one of the old royal dukes, was the
      only other person present at the interesting ceremony, save
      Pheasant-feathers, who lurked in one of the pews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret had been well kept, for the evening papers of that day and the
      morning ones of the next first proclaimed to the &ldquo;great world,&rdquo; that
      sphere of one&rsquo;s own acquaintance, that William Pringle, Esquire, of
      Doughty Street, Russell Square, was married to Miss Emma Willing, of&mdash;the
      papers did not say where.

      course were furious when they read the announcement of Billy&rsquo;s marriage.
      Such a degradation to such a respectable family, and communicated in such
      a way. We need scarcely say that at first they all made the worst of it,
      running Mrs. William down much below her real level, and declaring that
      Billy though hard enough in money matters, was soft enough in love
      affairs. Then Mrs. Half-a-yard-of-the-table Joe, who up to that time had
      been the <i>belle</i> of the family, essayed to pick her to pieces,
      intimating that she was much indebted to her dress&mdash;that fine
      feathers made fine birds&mdash;hoped that Billy would like paying for the
      clothes, and wondered what her figure would be like a dozen years thence.
      Mrs. Joe had preserved hers, never having indeed having been in the way of
      spoiling it. Joe looked as if he was to perpetuate the family name.
      By-and-by, when it became known that the Countess Delacey&rsquo;s yellow
      carriage, with the high-stepping greys and the cocked-up-nose
      beet-root-and-cherry-coloured Johnnies, was to be seen astonishing the
      natives in Doughty Street, they began to think better of it; and though
      they did not stint themselves for rudeness (disguised as civility of
      course), they treated her less like a show, more especially when Billy was
      present. Still, though they could not make up their minds to be really
      civil to her, they could not keep away from her, just as the moth will be
      at the candle despite its unpleasant consequences. Indeed, it is one of
      the marked characteristics of Snobbism, that they won&rsquo;t be cut. At least,
      if you do get a Snob cut, ten to one but he will take every opportunity of
      rubbing up against you, or sitting down beside you in public, or
      overtaking you on the road, or stopping a mutual acquaintance with you in
      the street, either to show his indifference or his independence, or in the
      hope of its passing for intimacy. There are people who can&rsquo;t understand
      any coolness short of a kick. The Pringles were tiresome people. They
      would neither be in with Mrs. William, nor out with her. So there was that
      continual knag, knag, knagging going on in the happy united family, that
      makes life so pleasant and enjoyable. Mrs. William well knew, when any of
      them came to call upon her, that her sayings and doings would furnish
      recreation for the rest of the cage. It is an agreeable thing to have
      people in one&rsquo;s house acting the part of spies. One day Mrs. Joe, who
      lived in Guildford Street, seeing the Countess&rsquo;s carriage-horses
      cold-catching in Doughty Street, while her ladyship discussed some
      important millinery question with Mrs. William, could not resist the
      temptation of calling, and not being introduced to the Countess, said to
      Mis. William, with her best vinegar sneer, the next time they met. She
      &ldquo;&lsquo;oped she had told her fine friend that the vulgar woman she saw at her
      &lsquo;ouse was no connection of her&rsquo;s.&rdquo; But enough of such nonsense. Let us on
      to something more pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then, of course the next step in our story is the appearance of our
      hero, the boy Billy&mdash;&mdash;Fine Billy, aforesaid. Such a boy as
      never was seen! All other mammas went away dissatisfied with theirs, after
      they had got a peep of our Billy. If baby-shows had been in existence in
      those days, Mrs. Billy might have scoured the country and carried away all
      the prizes. Everybody was struck in a heap at the sight of him, and his
      sayings and doings were worthy of a place in Punch. So thought his
      parents, at least. What perfected their happiness, of course, operated
      differently with the family, and eased the minds of the ladies, as to the
      expediency of further outward civility to Mrs. William, who they now
      snubbed at all points, and prophesied all sorts of uncharitableness of.
      Mrs., on her side, surpassed them all in dress and good looks, and bucked
      Billy up into a very produceable-looking article. Though he mightn&rsquo;t
      exactly do for White&rsquo;s bay-window on a summer afternoon, he looked
      uncommonly well on &ldquo;&lsquo;Change,&rdquo; and capitally in the country. Of course, he
      came in for one of the three cardinal sources of abuse the world is always
      so handy with, viz., that a man either behaves ill to his wife, is a
      screw, or is out-running the constable, the latter, of course, being
      Billy&rsquo;s crime, which admitted of a large amount of blame being laid on the
      lady, though, we are happy to say, Billy had no trial of speed with the
      constable, for his wife, by whose permission men thrive, was a capital
      manager, and Billy slapped his fat thigh over his beloved balance-sheets
      every Christmas, exclaiming, as he hopped joyously round on one leg,
      snapping his finger and thumb, &ldquo;<i>Our Billy shall be a gent! Our Billy
      shall be a gent!</i>&rdquo; And he half came in to the oft-expressed wish of his
      wife, that he might live to see him united to a quality lady: Mr. and Lady
      Arabella Pringle, Mr. and Lady Sophia Pringle, or Mr. and Lady Charlotte
      Elizabeth Pringle, as the case might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vainglorious ambition! After an inordinate kidney supper, poor Billy was
      found dead in his chair. Great was the consternation among the Pringle
      family at the lamentable affliction. All except Jerry, who, speculating on
      his habits, had recently effected a policy on his life, were deeply
      shocked at the event. They buried him with all becoming pomp, and then,
      Jerry, who had always professed great interest in the boy Billy&mdash;so
      great, indeed, as to induce his brother (though with no great opinion of
      Jerry, but hoping that his services would never be wanted, and that it
      might ingratiate the nephew with the bachelor uncle,) to appoint him an
      executor and guardian&mdash;waited upon the widow, and with worlds of
      tears and pious lamentations, explained to her in the most unexplanatory
      manner possible, all how things were left, but begging that she would not
      give herself any trouble about her son&rsquo;s affairs, for, if she would attend
      to his spiritual wants, and instil high principles of honour, morality,
      and fine feeling into his youthful mind, he would look after the mere
      worldly dross, which was as nothing compared to the importance of the
      other. &ldquo;Teach him to want nothin&rsquo; but what&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; continued Jerry, as
      he thought most impressively. &ldquo;Teach him to want nothin&rsquo; but what&rsquo;s right,
      and when he grows up to manhood marry him to some nice, pious respectable
      young woman in his own rank of life, with a somethin&rsquo; of her own;
      gentility is all very well to talk about, but it gets you nothin&rsquo; at the
      market,&rdquo; added he, forgetting that he was against the mere worldly dross.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Pringle, who knew the value of the article, intimated at an early
      day, that she would like to be admitted into the money partnership as
      well, whereupon Jerry waxing wroth, said with an irate glance of his keen
      grey eyes, &ldquo;My dear madam, these family matters, in my opinion, require to
      be treated not only in a business-like way, but with a very considerable
      degree of delicacy,&rdquo; an undisputed dogma, acquiring force only by the
      manner in which it was delivered. So the pretty widow saw she had better
      hold her tongue, and hope for the best from the little fawning bully.

    <p>
      The melancholy catastrophe with which we closed our last chapter found our
      hero at a preparatory school, studying for Eton, whither papa proposed
      sending him on the old principle of getting him into good society; though
      we believe it is an experiment that seldom succeeds. The widow, indeed,
      took this view of the matter, for her knowledge of high life caused her to
      know that though a &ldquo;proud aristocracy&rdquo; can condescend, and even worship
      wealth, yet that they are naturally clannish and exclusive, and tenacious
      of pedigree. In addition to this, Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s experience of men led her
      to think that the solemn pedantic &ldquo;Greek and Latin ones,&rdquo; as she called
      them, who know all about Julius Cæsar coming, &ldquo;<i>summa diligentia</i>,&rdquo;
       on the top of the diligence, were not half so agreeable as those who could
      dance and sing, and knew all that was going on in the present-day world;
      which, in addition to her just appreciation of the delicate position of
      her son, made her resolve not to risk him among the rising aristocracy at
      Eton, who, instead of advancing, might only damage his future prospects in
      life, but to send him to Paris, where, besides the three R&rsquo;s,&mdash;&ldquo;reading,
      riting, and rithmetic,&rdquo;&mdash;he would acquire all the elegant
      accomplishments and dawn fresh upon the world an unexpected meteor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This matter being arranged, she then left Dirty Street, as she called
      Doughty Street, with all the disagreeable Pringle family espionage, and
      reminiscences, and migrated westward, taking up her abode in the more
      congenial atmosphere of Curtain Crescent, Pimlico, or Belgravia, as, we
      believe the owners of the houses wish to have it called. Here she
      established herself in a very handsome, commodious house, with porticoed
      doorway and balconied drawing-rooms&mdash;every requisite for a genteel
      family in short; and such a mansion being clearly more than a single lady
      required, she sometimes accommodated the less fortunate, through the
      medium of a house-agent, though both he and she always begged it to be
      distinctly understood that she did not let lodgings, but &ldquo;apartments;&rdquo; and
      she always requested that the consideration might be sent to her in a
      sealed envelope by the occupants, in the same manner as she transmitted
      them the bill. So she managed to make a considerable appearance at a
      moderate expense, it being only in the full season that her heart yearned
      towards the houseless, when of course a high premium was expected. There
      is nothing uncommon in people letting their whole houses; so why should
      there be anything strange in Mrs. Pringle occasionally letting a part of
      one? Clearly nothing. Though Mrs. Joe did say she had turned a
      lodging-house keeper, she could not refrain from having seven-and-sixpence
      worth of Brougham occasionally to see how the land lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is but justice to our fair friend to say that she commenced with great
      prudence. So handsome unprotected a female being open to the criticisms of
      the censorious, she changed her good-looking footman for a sedate elderly
      man, whose name, Properjohn, John Properjohn, coupled with the severe
      austerity of his manners, was enough to scare away intruders, and to keep
      the young girls in order, whom our friend had consigned to her from the
      country, in the hopes that her drilling and recommendation would procure
      them admission into quality families.

    <p>
      Properjohn had been spoiled for high service by an attack of the jaundice,
      but his figure was stately and good, and she sought to modify his injured
      complexion by a snuff-coloured, Quaker-cut coat and vest, with
      claret-coloured shorts, and buckled shoes. Thus attired, with his
      oval-brimmed hat looped up with gold cord, and a large double-jointed
      brass-headed cane in his hand, he marched after his mistress, a damper to
      the most audacious. Properjohn, having lived in good families until he got
      spoiled by the jaundice, had a very extensive acquaintance among the
      aristocracy, with whom Mrs. Pringle soon established a peculiar
      intercourse. She became a sort of ultimate Court of Appeal, a <i>Cour de
      Cassation</i>, in all matters of taste in apparel,&mdash;whether a bonnet
      should be lilac or lavender colour, a dress deeply flounced or lightly, a
      lady go to a ball in feathers or diamonds, or both&mdash;in all those
      varying and perplexing points that so excite and bewilder the female mind:
      Mrs. Pringle would settle all these, whatever Mrs. Pringle said the fair
      applicants would abide by, and milliners and dress-makers submitted to her
      judgment. This, of course, let her into the privacies of domestic life.
      She knew what husbands stormed at the milliners&rsquo; and dress-makers&rsquo; bills,
      bounced at the price of the Opera-box, and were eternally complaining of
      their valuable horses catching cold. She knew who the cousin was who was
      always to be admitted in Lavender Square, and where the needle-case-shaped
      note went to after it had visited the toy-shop in Arcadia Street. If her
      own information was defective, Properjohn could supply the deficiency. The
      two, between them, knew almost everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s influence confined to the heads of houses, for it
      soon extended to many of the junior members also. It is a well known fact
      that, when the gorgeous Lady Rainbow came to consult her about her
      daughter&rsquo;s goings on with Captain Conquest, the Captain and Matilda saw
      Mamma alight from the flaunting hammer-clothed tub, as they stood behind
      the figured yellow tabaret curtains of Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s drawing-room window,
      whither they had been attracted by the thundering of one of the old noisy
      order of footmen. Blessings on the man, say we, who substituted bells for
      knockers&mdash;so that lovers may not be disturbed, or visitors
      unaccustomed to public knocking have to expose their incompetence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should, however, state, that whenever Mrs. Pringle was consulted by any
      of the juveniles upon their love affairs, she invariably suggested that
      they had better &ldquo;Ask Mamma,&rdquo; though perhaps it was only done as a matter
      of form, and to enable her to remind them at a future day, if things went
      wrong, that she had done so. Many people make offers that they never mean
      to have accepted, but still, if they are not accepted, <i>they made them
      you know</i>. If they are accepted, why then they wriggle out of them the
      best way they can. But we are dealing in generalities, instead of
      confining ourselves to Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s practice. If the young lady or
      gentleman&mdash;for Mrs. Pringle was equally accessible to the sexes&mdash;preferred
      &ldquo;asking&rdquo; her to &ldquo;Asking Mamma,&rdquo; Mrs. Pringle was always ready to do what
      she could for them; and the fine Sèvres and Dresden china, the opal vases,
      the Bohemian scent-bottles, the beautiful bronzes, the or-molu jewel
      caskets, and Parisian clocks, that mounted guard in the drawing-room when
      it was not &ldquo;in commission&rdquo; (occupied as apartments), spoke volumes for the
      gratitude of those she befriended. Mrs. Pringle was soon the repository of
      many secrets, but we need not say that the lady who so adroitly concealed
      Pheasant Feathers on her own account was not likely to be entrapped into
      committing others; and though she was often waited upon by pleasant
      conversationalists on far-fetched errands, who endeavoured to draw
      carelessly down wind to their point, as well as by seedy and half-seedy
      gentlemen, who proceeded in a more business-like style, both the pleasant
      conversationalists and the seedy and the half-seedy gentlemen went away as
      wise as they came. She never knew anything; it was the first she had heard
      of anything of the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, Mrs. Pringle was a wonderful woman, and not the least
      remarkable trait in her character was that, although servants, who, like
      the rest of the world, are so ready to pull people down to their own
      level, knew her early professional career, yet she managed them so well
      that they all felt an interest in elevating her, from the Duke&rsquo;s Duke,
      down to old quivering-calved Jeames de la Pluche, who sipped her hop
      champagne, and told all he heard while waiting at table&mdash;that festive
      period when people talk as if their attendants were cattle or inanimate
      beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will now have the goodness to consider our friend, Fine Billy,
      established with his handsome mother in Curtain Crescent&mdash;not
      Pimlico, but Belgravia&mdash;with all the airs and action described in our
      opening chapter. We have been a long time in working up to him, but the
      reader will not find the space wasted, inasmuch as it has given him a good
      introduction to &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; under whose auspices Billy will shortly have to
      grapple with the &ldquo;Ask Mamma&rdquo; world. Moreover, we feel that if there has
      been a piece of elegance overlooked by novelists generally, it is the
      delicate, sensitive, highly-refined lady&rsquo;s-maid. With these observations,
      we now pass on to the son He had exceeded, if possible, his good mother&rsquo;s
      Parisian anticipations, for if he had not brought away any great amount of
      learning, if he did not know a planet from a fixed star, the difference of
      oratory between Cicero and Demosthenes, or the history of Cupid and the
      minor heathen deities, he was nevertheless an uncommonly good hand at a
      polka, could be matched to waltz with any one, and had a tremendous
      determination of words to the mouth. His dancing propensities, indeed,
      were likely to mislead him at starting; for, not getting into the sort of
      society Mrs. Pringle wished to see him attain, he took up with Cremorne
      and Casinos, and questionable characters generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s own establishment, we are sorry to say, soon furnished her
      with the severest cause of disquietude; for having always acted upon the
      principle of having pretty maids&mdash;the difference, as she said,
      between pretty and plain ones being, that the men ran after the pretty
      ones, while the plain ones ran after the men&mdash;having always, we say,
      acted upon the principle of having pretty ones, she forgot to change her
      system on the return of her hopeful son; and before she knew where she
      was, he had established a desperate <i>liaison</i> with a fair maid whose
      aptitude for breakage had procured for her the <i>sobriquet</i> of Butter
      Fingers. Now, Butter Fingers, whose real name was Disher&mdash;Jane Disher&mdash;was
      a niece of our old friend, Big Ben, now a flourishing London hotel
      landlord, and Butter Fingers partook of the goodly properties and
      proportions for which the Ben family are distinguished. She was a little,
      plump, fair, round-about thing, with every quality of a healthy country
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fine Billy was first struck with her one Sunday afternoon, tripping along
      in Knightsbridge, as she was making her way home from Kensington Gardens,
      when the cheap finery&mdash;the parasol, the profusely-flowered white
      gauze bonnet, the veil, the machinery laced cloak, the fringed kerchief,
      worked sleeves, &amp;c., which she kept at Chickory the greengrocer&rsquo;s in
      Sun Street, and changed there for the quiet apparel in which she left Mrs.
      Pringle&rsquo;s house in Curtain Crescent&mdash;completely deceived him; as much
      as did the half-starting smile of recognition she involuntarily gave him
      on meeting. Great was his surprise to find that such a smart,
      neat-stepping, well-set-up, <i>bien chaussée</i> beauty and he came from
      the same quarters. We need not say what followed: how Properjohn couldn&rsquo;t
      see what everybody else saw; and how at length poor Mrs. Pringle, having
      changed her mind about going to hear Mr. Spurgeon, caught the two sitting
      together, on her richly carved sofa of chaste design, in the then
      non-commissioned put-away drawing room. There was Butter Fingers in a
      flounced book-muslin gown with a broad French sash, and her hair clubbed
      at the back <i>à la</i> crow&rsquo;s-nest. It was hard to say which of the three
      got the greatest start, though the blow was undoubtedly the severest on
      the poor mother, who had looked forward to seeing her son entering the
      rank of life legitimately in which she had occupied a too questionable
      position. The worst of it was, she did not know what to do&mdash;whether
      to turn her out of the house at the moment, and so infuriate the uncle and
      her son also, or give her a good scolding, and get rid of her on the first
      plausible opportunity. She had no one to consult. She knew what
      &ldquo;Want-nothin&rsquo;-but-what&rsquo;s-right Jerry&rdquo; would say, and that nothing would
      please Mrs. Half-a-yard-of-the-table Joe more than to read the marriage of
      Billy and Butter Fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pringle was afraid too of offending Big Ben by the abrupt dismissal
      of his niece, and dreaded if Butter Fingers had gained any ascendancy over
      William, that he too might find a convenient marrying place as somebody
      else had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether our fair friend was terribly perplexed. Thrown on the natural
      resources of her own strong mind, she thought, perhaps, the usual way of
      getting young ladies off bad matches, by showing them something better,
      might be tried with her son. Billy&rsquo;s <i>début</i> in the metropolis had
      not been so flattering as she could have wished, but then she could make
      allowances for town exclusiveness, and the pick and choice of dancing
      activity which old family connections and associations supplied. The
      country was very different; there, young men were always in request, and
      were taken with much lighter credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, thought she, sweet William could but manage to establish a good
      country connection, there was no saying but he might retain it in town; at
      all events, the experiment would separate him from the artful Butter
      Fingers, and pave the way for her dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      To accomplish this desirable object, Mrs. Pringle therefore devoted her
      undivided attention.

      CHAPTER VII.<br/>THE EARL OF LADYTHORNE.&mdash;MISS DE GLANCEY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>MONG Mrs.
      Pringle&rsquo;s many visitors was that gallant old philanthropist, the
      well-known Earl of Ladythorne, of Tantivy Castle, Featherbedfordshire and
      Belvedere House, London.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship had known her at Lady Delacey&rsquo;s, and Mrs. Pringle still wore
      and prized a ruby ring he slipped upon her finger as he met her
      (accidentally of course) in the passage early one morning as he was going
      to hunt. His saddle-horses might often be seen of a summer afternoon,
      tossing their heads up and down Curtain Crescent, to the amusement of the
      inhabitants of that locality. His lordship indeed was a well-known general
      patron of all that was fair and fine and handsome in creation, fine women,
      fine houses, fine horses, fine hounds, fine pictures, fine statues, fine
      every thing. No pretty woman either in town or country ever wanted a
      friend if he was aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had long hunted Featherbedfordshire in a style of great magnificence,
      and though latterly his energies had perhaps been as much devoted to the
      pursuit of the fair as the fox, yet, as he found the two worked well
      together, he kept up the hunting establishment with all the splendour of
      his youth. Not that he was old: as he would say, &ldquo;<i>far from it!</i>&rdquo;
       Indeed, to walk behind him down St. James&rsquo;s Street (he does not go quite so
      well up), his easy jaunty air, tall graceful figure, and elasticity of
      step, might make him pass for a man in that most uncertain period of
      existence the &ldquo;prime of life,&rdquo; and if uncivil, unfriendly, inexorable time
      has whitened his pow, his lordship carries it off with the aid of gay
      costume and colour. He had a great reputation among the ladies, and though
      they all laughed and shook their heads when his name was mentioned, from
      the pretty simpering Mrs. Ringdove, of Lime-Tree Grove, who said he was a
      &ldquo;naughty man,&rdquo; down to the buxom chambermaid of the Rose and Crown, who
      giggled and called him a &ldquo;gay old gentleman,&rdquo; they all felt pleased and
      flattered by his attentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hunting a country undoubtedly gives gay old gentlemen great opportunities,
      for, under pretence of finding a fox, they may rummage any where from the
      garret<a href="#linknote-1" name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1">[1]</a> to the cellar.

&ldquo;A Fox Run into a Lady&rsquo;s Dressing-Room.—The Heythrop hounds met at
Ranger&rsquo;s Lodge, within about a mile of Charlbury, found in Hazell Wood,
and went away through Great Cranwell, crossing the park of Cornbury, on by the
old kennel to Live Oak, taking the side hill, leaving Leafield (so celebrated
for clay-pipes) to his left, crossed the bottom by Five Ashes; then turned to
the right, through King&rsquo;s Wood. Smallstones, Knighton Copse, over the
plain to Ranger&rsquo;s Lodge, with the hounds close at his brush, where they
left him in a mysterious manner. After the lapse of a little time he was
discovered by a maid- servant in the ladies&rsquo; dressing-room, from which he
immediately bolted on the appearance of the petticoats, without doing the
slightest damage to person or property."—Bell&rsquo;s Life. What a gentlemanly
fox!
</p>

    <p>
      In this interesting pursuit, his lordship was ably assisted by his
      huntsman, Dicky Boggledike. Better huntsman there might be than Dicky,
      but none so eminently qualified for the double pursuit of the fox and the
      fine. He had a great deal of tact and manner, and looked and was
      essentially a nobleman&rsquo;s servant. He didn&rsquo;t come blurting
      open-mouthed with &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a davilish,&rdquo; for such was
      his dialect, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a davilish fine oss, my lord,&rdquo;
      or &ldquo;They say Mrs. Candle&rsquo;s cow has gained another
      prize,&rdquo; but he would take an opportunity of introducing the subject
      neatly and delicately, through the medium of some allusion to the country
      in which they were to be found, some cover wanting cutting, some poacher
      wanting trouncing, or some puppy out at walk, so that if his lordship
      didn&rsquo;t seem to come into the humour of the thing, Dicky could whip
      off to the other scent as if he had nothing else in his mind. It was
      seldom, however, that his lordship was not inclined to profit by
      Dicky&rsquo;s experience, for he had great sources of information, and
      was very careful in his statements. His lordship and Dicky had now hunted
      Featherbedfordshire together for nearly forty years, and though they
      might not be so punctual in the mornings, or so late in leaving off in
      the evenings, as they were; and though his lordship might come to the
      meet in his carriage and four with the reigning favourite by his side,
      instead of on his neat cover hack, and though Dicky did dance longer at
      his fences than he used, still there was no diminution in the scale of
      the establishment, or in Dicky&rsquo;s influence throughout the country.
      Indeed, it would rather seem as if the now well-matured hunt ran to show
      instead of sport, for each succeeding year brought out either another
      second horseman (though neither his lordship nor Dicky ever tired one),
      or another man in a scarlet and cap, or established another Rose and
      Crown, whereat his lordship kept dry things to change in case he got wet.
      He was uncommonly kind to himself, and hated his heir with an intensity
      of hatred which was at once the best chance for longevity and for
      sustaining the oft-disappointed ambitious hopes of the fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mrs. Pringle had always had a very laudable admiration of fox-hunters.
      She thought the best introduction for a young man of fortune was at the
      cover side, and though Jerry Pringle (who looked upon them as synonymous)
      had always denounced &ldquo;gamblin&rsquo; and huntin&rsquo;&rdquo; as the two greatest vices of
      the day, she could never come in to that opinion, as far as hunting was
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now thought if she could get Billy launched under the auspices of that
      distinguished sportsman, the Earl of Ladythorne, it might be the means of
      reclaiming him from Butter Fingers, and getting him on in society, for she
      well knew how being seen at one good place led to another, just as the
      umbrella-keepers at the Royal Academy try to lead people into giving them
      something in contravention of the rule above their heads, by jingling a
      few half-pence before their faces. Moreover, Billy had shown an
      inclination for equitation&mdash;by nearly galloping several of Mr.
      Spavin, the neighbouring livery-stable-keeper&rsquo;s horses&rsquo; tails off; and
      Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s knowledge of hunting not being equal to her appreciation of
      the sport, she thought that a master of hounds found all the gentlemen who
      joined his hunt in horses, just as a shooter finds them in dogs or guns,
      so that the thing would be managed immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, like many ladies, she had rather a confused idea of the whole
      thing, not knowing but that one horse would hunt every day in the week; or
      that there was any distinction of horses, further than the purposes to
      which they were applied. Hunters and racehorses she had no doubt were the
      same animals, working their ways honestly from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end,
      or at most with only the sort of difference between them that there is
      between a milliner and a dressmaker. Be that as it may, however, all
      things considered, Mrs. Pringle determined to test the sincerity of her
      friend the Earl of Ladythorne: and to that end wrote him a gossiping sort
      of letter, asking, in the postscript, when his dogs would be going out, as
      her son was at home and would &ldquo;<i>so like</i>&rdquo; to see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although we introduced Lord Ladythorne as a philanthropist, his
      philanthropy, we should add, was rather lop-sided, being chiefly confined
      to the fair. Indeed, he could better stand a dozen women than one man. He
      had no taste or sympathy, for the hirsute tribe, hence his fields were
      very select, being chiefly composed of his dependents and people whom he
      could d&mdash;&mdash; and do what he liked with. Though the Crumpletin
      Railway cut right through his country, making it &ldquo;varry contagious,&rdquo; as
      Harry Swan, his first whip, said, for sundry large towns, the sporting
      inhabitants thereof preferred the money-griping propensities of a certain
      Baronet&mdash;Sir Moses Mainchance&mdash;whose acquaintance the reader
      will presently make, to the scot-free sport with the frigid civilities of
      the noble Earl. Under ordinary circumstances, therefore, Mrs. Pringle had
      made rather an unfortunate selection for her son&rsquo;s <i>début</i>, but it so
      happened that her letter found the Earl in anything but his usual frame of
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was suffering most acutely for the hundred and twentieth time or so
      from one of Cupid&rsquo;s shafts, and that too levelled by a hand against whose
      attacks he had always hitherto been thought impervious. This wound had
      been inflicted by the well-known&mdash;perhaps to some of our readers too
      well-known&mdash;equestrian coquette, Miss de Glancey of
      Half-the-watering-places-in-England-and-some-on-the-Continent, whose many
      conquests had caused her to be regarded as almost irresistible, and
      induced, it was said&mdash;with what degree of truth we know not&mdash;a
      party of England&rsquo;s enterprising sons to fit her out for an expedition
      against the gallant Earl of Ladythorne under the Limited Liability Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, none but a most accomplished, self-sufficient coquette, such as Miss
      de Glancey undoubtedly was, would have undertaken such an enterprise, for
      it was in direct contravention of two of the noble Earl&rsquo;s leading
      principles, namely, that of liking large ladies (fine, coarse women, as
      the slim ones call them,) and of disliking foxhunting ones, the sofa and
      not the saddle being, as he always said, the proper place for the ladies;
      but Miss de Glancey prided herself upon her power of subjugating the
      tyrant man, and gladly undertook to couch the lance of blandishment
      against the hitherto impracticable nobleman. In order, however, to
      understand the exact position of parties, perhaps the reader will allow us
      to show how his lordship came to be seized with his present attack, and
      also how he treated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the ash was yellow, the beech was brown, and the oak ginger
      coloured, and the indomitable youth was again in cub-hunting costume&mdash;a
      white beaver hat, a green cut-away, a buff vest, with white cords and
      caps, attended by Boggledike and his whips in hats, and their last
      season&rsquo;s pinks or purples, disturbing the numerous litters of cubs with
      which the country abounded, when, after a musical twenty minutes with a
      kill in Allonby Wood, his lordship joined horses with Dicky, to discuss
      the merits of the performance, as they rode home together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas, my lord, yas,&rdquo; replied Dicky, sawing away at his hat, in reply to
      his lordship&rsquo;s observation that they ran uncommonly well; &ldquo;yas, my lord,
      they did. I don&rsquo;t know that I can ever remamber bein&rsquo; better pleased with
      an entry than I am with this year&rsquo;s. I really think in a few more seasons
      we shall get &rsquo;em as near parfection as possible. Did your lordship notish
      that Barbara betch, how she took to runnin&rsquo; to-day? The first time she has
      left my oss&rsquo;s eels. Her mother, old Blossom, was jest the same. Never left
      my oss&rsquo;s eels the first season, and everybody said she was fit for nothin&rsquo; 
      but the halter; but my!&rdquo; continued he, shaking his head, &ldquo;what a rare
      betch she did become.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did that,&rdquo; replied his lordship, smiling at Dicky&rsquo;s pronunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that reminds me,&rdquo; continued Dicky, emboldened by what he thought the
      encouragement, &ldquo;I was down at Freestone Banks yasterday, where Barbara was
      walked, a seein&rsquo; a pup I have there now, and I think I seed the very
      neatest lady&rsquo;s pad I ever set eyes on!&rdquo;&mdash;Dicky&rsquo;s light-blue eyes
      settling on his lordship&rsquo;s eagle ones as he spoke. &ldquo;Aye! who&rsquo;s was that?&rdquo;
       asked the gay old gentleman, catching at the word &ldquo;lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, they say she belongs to a young lady from the south&mdash;a Miss
      Dedancey, I think they call her,&rdquo; with the aptitude people have for
      mistaking proper names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dedancey,&rdquo; repeated his lordship, &ldquo;Dedancey; never heard of the name
      before&mdash;what&rsquo;s set her here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s styin&rsquo; at Mrs. Roseworth&rsquo;s, at Lanecroft House, but her osses stand
      at the Spread Heagle, at Bush Dill&mdash;Old Sam &lsquo;Utchison&rsquo;s, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Indomitable Youth</i>. Horses! what, has she more than one?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dicky</i>. Two, a bay and a gray,&mdash;it&rsquo;s the bay that takes my
      fancy most:&mdash;the neatest stepper, with the lightest month, and
      fairest, freeest, truest action I ever seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Indomitable Youth</i>. What&rsquo;s she going to do with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dicky.</i> Ride them, ride them! They say she&rsquo;s the finest oss-woman
      that ever was seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In-deed,&rdquo; mused his lordship, thinking over the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i>
      of female equestrianism,&mdash;the disagreeableness of being beat by them,&mdash;the
      disagreeableness of having to leave them in the lurch,&mdash;the
      disagreeableness of seeing them floored,&mdash;the disagreeableness of
      seeing them all running down with perspiration;&mdash;the result being
      that his lordship adhered to his established opinion that women have no
      business out hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dicky knew his lordship&rsquo;s sentiments, and did not press the matter, but
      drew his horse a little to the rear, thinking it fortunate that all men
      are not of the same way of thinking. Thus they rode on for some distance
      in silence, broken only by the occasional flopping and chiding of Harry
      Swan or his brother whip of some loitering or refractory hound. His
      lordship had a great opinion of Dicky&rsquo;s judgment, and though they might
      not always agree in their views, he never damped Dicky&rsquo;s ardour by openly
      differing with him. He thought by Dicky&rsquo;s way of mentioning the lady that
      he had a good opinion of her, and, barring the riding, his lordship saw no
      reason why he should not have a good opinion of her too. Taking advantage
      of the Linton side-bar now bringing them upon the Somerton-Longville road,
      he reined in his horse a little so as to let Dicky come alongside of him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this young lady like?&rdquo; asked the indomitable youth, as soon as
      they got their horses to step pleasantly together again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; replied Dicky, screwing up his mouth, with an apologetic touch
      of his hat, knowing that that was his weak point, &ldquo;well now, I don&rsquo;t mean
      to say that she&rsquo;s zactly&mdash;no, not zactly, your lordship&rsquo;s model,&mdash;not
      a large full-bodied woman like Mrs. Blissland or Miss Poach, but an
      elegant, <i>very</i> elegant, well-set-up young lady, with a high-bred
      hair about her that one seldom sees in the country, for though we breeds
      our women very beautiful&mdash;uncommon &lsquo;andsome, I may say&mdash;we don&rsquo;t
      polish them hup to that fine degree of parfection that they do in the
      towns, and even if we did they would most likely spoil the &lsquo;ole thing by
      some untoward unsightly dress, jest as a country servant spoils a London
      livery by a coloured tie, or goin&rsquo; about with a great shock head of &lsquo;air,
      or some such disfigurement; but this young lady, to my mind, is a perfect
      pictor, self, oss, and seat,&mdash;all as neat and perfect as can be, and
      nothing that one could either halter or amend. She is what, savin&rsquo; your
      lordship&rsquo;s presence, I might call the &lsquo;pink of fashion and the mould of
      form!&rsquo;&mdash;Dicky sawing away at his hat as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tall, slim, and genteel, I suppose,&rdquo; observed his lordship drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest so,&rdquo; assented Dicky, with a chuck of the chin, making a clean breast
      of it, &ldquo;jest so,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;at least as far as one can judge of her in her
      &lsquo;abit, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought so,&rdquo; muttered his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      And having now gained one of the doors in the wall, they cut across the
      deer-studded park, and were presently back at the Castle. And his lordship
      ate his dinner, and quaffed his sweet and dry and twenty-five Lafitte
      without ever thinking about either the horse, or the lady, or the habit,
      or anything connected with the foregoing conversation, while the reigning
      favourite, Mrs. Moffatt, appeared just as handsome as could be in his
      eyes.

    <p>
      THOUGH his lordship, as we said before, would stoutly deny being old, he
      had nevertheless got sufficiently through the morning of life not to let
      cub-hunting get him out of bed a moment sooner than usual, and it was
      twelve o&rsquo;clock on the next day but one to that on which the foregoing
      conversation took place, that Mr. Boggledike was again to be seen standing
      erect in his stirrups, yoiking and coaxing his hounds into Crashington
      Gorse. There was Dicky, cap-in-hand, in the Micentre ride, exhorting the
      young hounds to dive into the strong sea of gorse. &ldquo;<i>Y-o-o-icks! wind
      him! y-o-o-icks! pash him up!</i>&rdquo; cheered the veteran, now turning his
      horse across to enforce the request. There was his lordship at the high
      corner as usual, ensconced among the clump of weather-beaten blackthorns&mdash;thorns
      that had neither advanced nor receded a single inch since he first knew
      them,&mdash;his eagle eye fixed on the narrow fern and coarse
      grass-covered dell down which Reynard generally stole. There was Harry
      Swan at one corner to head the fox back from the beans, and Tom Speed at
      the other to welcome him away over the corn-garnered open. And now the
      whimper of old sure-finding Harbinger, backed by the sharp &ldquo;yap&rdquo; of the
      terrier, proclaims that our friend is at home, and presently a perfect
      hurricane of melody bursts from the agitated gorse,&mdash;every hound is
      in the paroxysm of excitement, and there are five-and-twenty couple of
      them, fifty musicians in the whole!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tally-ho!</i> there he goes across the ride!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Cub!</i>&rdquo; cries his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Cub!</i>&rdquo; responded Dicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Crack!</i>&rdquo; sounds the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the whole infuriated phalanx dashed across the ride and dived into the
      close prickly gorse on the other side as if it were the softest,
      pleasantest quarters in the world. There is no occasion to coax, and
      exhort, and ride cap-in-hand to them now. It&rsquo;s all fury and commotion.
      Each hound seems to consider himself personally aggrieved,&mdash;though we
      will be bound to say the fox and he never met in their lives,&mdash;and to
      be bent upon having immediate satisfaction. And immediate, any tyro would
      think it must necessarily be, seeing such preponderating influence brought
      to bear upon so small an animal. Not so, however: pug holds his own; and,
      by dint of creeping, and crawling, and stopping, and listening, and lying
      down, and running his foil, he brings the lately rushing, clamorous pack
      to a more plodding, pains-taking, unravelling sort of performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile three foxes in succession slip away, one at Speed&rsquo;s corner, two
      at Swan&rsquo;s; and though Speed screeched, and screamed, and yelled, as if he
      were getting killed, not a hound came to see what had happened. They all
      stuck to the original scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he comes again!&rdquo; now cries his lordship from his thorn-formed bower,
      as the cool-mannered fox again steals across the ride, and Dicky again
      uncovers, and goes through the capping ceremony. Over come the pack,
      bristling and lashing for blood&mdash;each hound looking as if he would
      eat the fox single-handed. Now he&rsquo;s up to the high corner as though he
      were going to charge his lordship himself, and passing over fresh ground
      the hounds get the benefit of a scent, and work with redoubled energy,
      making the opener gorse bushes crack and bend with their pressure. Pug has
      now gained the rabbit-burrowed bank of the north fence, and has about made
      up his mind to follow the example of his comrades, and try his luck in the
      open, when a cannonading crack of Swan&rsquo;s whip strikes terror into his
      heart, and causes him to turn tail, and run the moss-grown mound of the
      hedge. Here he unexpectedly meets young Prodigal face to face, who,
      thinking that rabbit may be as good eating as fox, has got up a little
      hunt of his own, and who is considerably put out of countenance by the <i>rencontre</i>;
      but pug, not anticipating any such delicacy on the part of a pursuer,
      turns tail, and is very soon in the rear of the hounds, hunting them
      instead of their hunting him. The thing then becomes more difficult,
      businesslike, and sedate&mdash;the sages of the pack taking upon them to
      guide the energy of the young. So what with the slow music of the hounds,
      the yap, yap, yapping of the terriers, and the shaking of the gorse, an
      invisible underground sort of hunt is maintained&mdash;his lordship
      sitting among his blackthorn bushes like a gentleman in his opera-stall,
      thinking now of the hunt, now of his dinner, now of what a good thing it
      was to be a lord, with a good digestion and plenty of cash, and nobody to
      comb his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      At length pug finds it too hot to hold him. The rays of an autumnal sun
      have long been striking into the gorse, while a warm westerly wind does
      little to ventilate it from the steam of the rummaging inquisitive pack.
      Though but a cub, he is the son of an old stager, who took Dicky and his
      lordship a deal of killing, and with the talent of his sire, he thus
      ruminates on his uncomfortable condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I stay here, I shall either be smothered or fall a prey to
      these noisy unrelenting monsters, who seem to have the knack of finding me
      wherever I go. I&rsquo;d better cut my stick as I did the time before, and have
      fresh air and exercise at all events, in the open:&rdquo; so saying he made a
      dash at the hedge near where Swan was stationed, and regardless of his
      screams and the cracks of his whip, cut through the beans and went away,
      with a sort of defiant whisk of his brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a commotion followed his departure! How the screeches of the men
      mingled with the screams of the hounds and the twangs of the horn! In an
      instant his lordship vacates his opera-stall and is flying over the ragged
      boundary fence that separates him from the beans; while Mr. Boggledike
      capers and prances at a much smaller place, looking as if he would fain
      turn away were it not for the observation of the men. Now Dicky is over!
      Swan and Speed take it in their stride, just as the last hound leaves the
      gorse and strains to regain his distant companions. A large grass field,
      followed by a rough bare fallow, takes the remaining strength out of poor
      pug; and, turning short to the left, he seeks the friendless shelter of a
      patch of wretched oats. The hounds overrun the scent, but, spreading like
      a rocket, they quickly recover it; and in an instant, fox, hounds, horses,
      men, are among the standing corn,&mdash;one ring in final destruction of
      the beggarly crop, and poor pug is in the hands of his pursuers. Then came
      the grand <i>finale</i>, the <i>who hoop!</i> the baying, the blowing, the
      beheading, &amp;c. Now Harry Swan, whose province it is to magnify sport
      and make imaginary runs to ground, exercises his calling, by declaring it
      was five-and-thirty minutes (twenty perhaps), and the finest young fox he
      ever had hold of. Now his lordship and Dicky take out their <i>tootlers</i>
      and blow a shrill reverberating blast; while Swan stands straddling and
      yelling, with the mangled remains high above his head, ready to throw it
      into the sea of mouths that are baying around to receive it. After a
      sufficiency of noise, up goes the carcase; the wave of hounds breaks
      against it as it falls, while a half-ravenous, half-indignant, growling
      worry succeeds the late clamourous outcry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tear &lsquo;im and eat &lsquo;im!&rdquo; cries Dicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tear &lsquo;im and eat &lsquo;im!&rdquo; shouts his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tear &lsquo;im and eat &lsquo;im!&rdquo; shrieks Speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hie worry! worry! worry!</i>&rdquo; shouts Swan, trying to tantalize the
      young hounds with a haunch, which, however, they do not seem much to care
      about.

      The old hounds, too, seem as if they had lost their hunger with their
      anger; and Marmion lets Warrior run off with his leg with only a snap and
      an indignant rise of his bristles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether the froth and effervescence of the thing has evaporated; so his
      lordship and Dicky turning their horses&rsquo; heads, the watchful hounds give a
      bay of obedient delight as they frolic under their noses; and Swan having
      reclaimed his horse from Speed, the onward procession is formed to give
      Brambleton Wood a rattle by way of closing the performance of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship and Dicky ride side by side, extolling the merits of the pack
      and the excellence of Crashington Gorse. Never was so good a cover. Never
      was a better pack. Mainchance&rsquo;s! <i>pooh!</i> Not to be mentioned in the
      same century. So they proceed, magnifying and complimenting themselves in
      the handsomest terms possible, down Daisyfield lane, across Hill House
      pastures, and on by Duston Mills to Broomley, which is close to Brambleton
      Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of our Featherbedfordshire friends will remember that after leaving
      Duston Mills the roads wind along the impetuous Lime, whose thorn and
      broom-grown banks offer dry, if not very secure, accommodation for master
      Reynard; and the draw being pretty, and the echo fine, his lordship
      thought they might as well run the hounds along the banks, not being aware
      that Peter Hitter, Squire Porker&rsquo;s keeper, had just emerged at the east
      end as they came up at the west. However, that was neither here nor there,
      Dicky got his <i>Y-o-o-icks</i>, his lordship got his view, Swan and Speed
      their cracks and canters, and it was all in the day&rsquo;s work. No fox, of
      course, was the result. &ldquo;<i>Tweet, tweet, tweet</i>,&rdquo; went the horns, his
      lordship taking a blow as well as Dicky, which sounded up the valley and
      lost itself among the distant hills. The hounds came straggling leisurely
      out of cover, as much as to say, &ldquo;You know there never <i>is</i> a fox
      there, so why bother us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All hands being again united, the cavalcade rose the hill, and were
      presently on the Longford and Aldenbury turnpike. Here the
      Featherbedfordshire reader&rsquo;s local knowledge will again remind him that
      the Chaddleworth lane crosses the turnpike at right angles, and just as
      old Ringwood, who, as usual, was trotting consequentially in advance of
      the pack, with the fox&rsquo;s head in his mouth, got to the finger-post, a fair
      equestrian on a tall blood bay rode leisurely past with downcast eyes in
      full view of the advancing party. Though her horse whinnied and shied, and
      seemed inclined to be sociable, she took no more notice of the cause than
      if it had been a cart, merely coaxing and patting him with her delicate
      primrose-coloured kid gloves. So she got him past without even a sidelong
      look from herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though she did not look my lord did, and was much struck with the air
      and elegance of everything&mdash;her mild classic features&mdash;her
      black-felt, Queen&rsquo;s-patterned, wide-awake, trimmed with lightish-green
      velvet, and green cock-feathered plume, tipped with straw-colour to match
      the ribbon that now gently fluttered at her fair neck,&mdash;her hair, her
      whip, her gloves, her <i>tout ensemble</i>. Her lightish-green habit was
      the quintessence of a fit, and altogether there was a high-bred finish
      about her that looked more like Hyde Park than what one usually sees in
      the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the deuce is that, Dicky?&rdquo; asked his lordship, as she now got out of
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That be <i>her</i>, my lord,&rdquo; whispered Dicky, sawing away at his hat.
      &ldquo;That be <i>her</i>,&rdquo; repeated he with a knowing leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Her!</i> who d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; asked his lordship, who had forgotten all
      Dicky&rsquo;s preamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;What&rsquo;s her name&mdash;Dedancev,
      Dedancey,&mdash;the lady I told you about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Earl&rsquo;s heart smote him, for he felt that he had done injustice to
      Dicky, and moreover, had persevered too long in his admiration of large
      ladies, and in his repudiation of horsemanship. He thought he had never
      seen such a graceful seat, or such a piece of symmetrical elegance before,
      and inwardly resolved to make Dicky a most surprising present at
      Christmas, for he went on the principle of giving low wages, and of
      rewarding zeal and discretion, such as Dicky&rsquo;s, profusely. And though he
      went and drew Brambleton Wood, he was thinking far more of the fair maid,
      her pensive, downcast look, her long eyelashes, her light silken hair, her
      graceful figure, and exquisite seat, than of finding a fox; and he was not
      at all sorry when he heard Dicky&rsquo;s horn at the bridle-gate at the Ashburne
      end blowing the hounds out of cover. They then went home, and his lordship
      was very grumpy all that evening with his fat fair-and-forty friend, Mrs.
      Moffatt, who could not get his tea to his liking at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dare say most of our readers will agree with us, that when a couple
      want to be acquainted there is seldom much difficulty about the matter,
      even though there be no friendly go-between to mutter the cabalistic words
      that constitute an introduction; and though Miss de Glancey did ride so
      unconcernedly past, it was a sheer piece of acting, as she had long been
      waiting at Carlton Clumps, which commands a view over the surrounding
      country, timing herself for the exact spot where she met the too
      susceptible Earl and his hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knew better how to angle for admiration than this renowned young
      lady,&mdash;when to do the bold&mdash;when the bashful&mdash;when the
      timid&mdash;when the scornful and retiring, and she rightly calculated
      that the way to attract and win the young old Earl was to look as if she
      didn&rsquo;t want to have anything to say to him. Her downcast look, and
      utter indifference to that fertile source of introduction, a pack of
      hounds, had sunk deeper into his tender heart than if she had pulled up
      to admire them collectively, and to kiss them individually. We all know
      how useful a dog can be made in matters of this sort&mdash;how the fair
      creatures can express their feelings by their fondness. And if one dog
      can be so convenient, by how much more so can a whole pack of hounds be
      made!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.<br/>A PUP AT WALK.&mdash;IMPERIAL JOHN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span> ext day his
      lordship, who was of the nice old Andlesey school of dressers, was to be
      seen in regular St. James&rsquo;s Street attire, viz. a bright blue coat with
      gilt buttons, a light blue scarf, a buff vest with fawn-coloured leathers,
      and brass heel spurs, capering on a long-tailed silver dun, attended by a
      diminutive rosy-cheeked boy&mdash;known in the stables as
      Cupid-without-Wings&mdash;on a bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to see a pup he had at walk at Freestone Banks, of which the
      reader will remember Dicky had spoken approvingly on a previous day; and
      the morning being fine and sunny, his lordship took the bridle-road over
      Ashley Downs, and along the range of undulating Heathmoor Hills, as well
      for the purpose of enjoying the breeze as of seeing what was passing in
      the vale below. So he tit-up&rsquo;d and tit-up&rsquo;d away, over the sound green
      sward, on his flowing-tailed steed, his keen far-seeing eye raking all the
      roads as he went. There seemed to be nothing stirring but heavy crushing
      waggons, with doctor&rsquo;s gigs and country carts, and here and there a
      slow-moving steed of the grand order of agriculture.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, however, he got to the broken stony ground where all the independent
      hill tracks join in common union to effect the descent into the vale, his
      hack pricked his ears, and looking a-head to the turn of the lane into
      which the tracks ultimately resolved themselves, his lordship first saw a
      fluttering, light-tipped feather, and then the whole figure of a
      horsewoman, emerge from the concealing hedge as it were on to the open
      space beyond. Miss, too, had been on the hills, as the Earl might have
      seen by her horse&rsquo;s imprints, if he had not been too busy looking abroad;
      and she had just had time to effect the descent as he approached. She was
      now sauntering along as unconcernedly as if there was nought but herself
      and her horse in the world. His lordship started when he saw her, and a
      crimson flush suffused his healthy cheeks as he drew his reins, and felt
      his hack gently with his spur to induce him to use a little more
      expedition down the hill. Cupid-without-Wings put on also, to open the
      rickety gate at the bottom, and his lordship telling him, as he passed
      through, to &ldquo;shut it gently,&rdquo; pressed on at a well-in-hand trot, which he
      could ease down to a walk as he came near the object of his pursuit.
      Miss&rsquo;s horse heard footsteps coming and looked round, but she pursued the
      even tenour of her way apparently indifferent to everything&mdash;even to
      a garotting. His lordship, however, was not to be daunted by any such
      coolness; so stealing quietly alongside of her, he raised his hat
      respectfully, and asked, in his mildest, blandest tone, if she had &ldquo;seen a
      man with a hound in a string?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hound! me! see!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Miss de Glancey, with a well feigned
      start of astonishment. &ldquo;<i>No, sir, I have not,</i>&rdquo; continued she
      haughtily, as if recovering herself, and offended by the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my hounds startled your horse the other day,&rdquo; observed his
      lordship, half inclined to think she didn&rsquo;t know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, they didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied she with an upward curl of her pretty lip;
      &ldquo;my horse is not so easily startled as that; are you, Cock Robin?&rdquo; asked
      she, leaning forward to pat him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cock Robin replied by laying back his ears, and taking a snatch at his
      lordship&rsquo;s hack&rsquo;s silver mane, which afforded him an opportunity of
      observing that Cock Robin was not very sociable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Not with strangers</i>,&rdquo; pouted Miss de Glancey, with a flash of her
      bright hazel eyes. So saying, she touched her horse lightly with her
      gold-mounted whip, and in an instant she was careering away, leaving his
      lordship to the care of the now grinning Cupid-without-Wings.

      And thus the mynx held the sprightly youth in tow, till she nearly drove
      him mad, not missing any opportunity of meeting him, but never giving him
      too much of her company, and always pouting at the suggestion of <i>her</i>
      marrying a &ldquo;<i>mere fox-hunter.</i>&rdquo; The whole thing, of course, furnished
      conversation for the gossips, and Mr. Boggledike, as in duty bound,
      reported what he heard. She puzzled his lordship more than any lady he had
      ever had to do with, and though he often resolved to strike and be free,
      he had only to meet her again to go home more subjugated than ever. And so
      what between Miss de Glancey out of doors and Mrs. Moffatt in, he began to
      have a very unpleasant time of it. His hat had so long covered his family,
      that he hardly knew how to set about obtaining his own consent to marry;
      and yet he felt that he ought to marry if it was only to spite his odious
      heir&mdash;<i>old</i> General Binks; for his lordship called him old
      though the General was ten years younger than himself; but still he would
      like to look about him a little longer. What he would now wish to do would
      be to keep Miss de Glancey in the country, for he felt interested in her,
      and thought she would be ornamental to the pack. Moreover, he liked all
      that was handsome, <i>piquant</i>, and gay, and to be joked about the
      Featherbedfordshire witches when he went to town. So he resolved himself
      into a committee of ways and means, to consider how the object was to be
      effected, without surrendering himself. That must be the last resource at
      all events, thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now upon his lordship&rsquo;s vast estates was a most unmitigated block-head
      called Imperial John, from his growing one of those chin appendages. His
      real name was Hybrid&mdash;John Hybrid, of Barley Hill Farm; but his
      handsome sister, &ldquo;Imperial Jane,&rdquo; as the wags called her, having attracted
      his lordship&rsquo;s attention, to the danger as it was thought of old Binks, on
      leaving her furnishing seminary at Turnham Green, John had been taken by
      the hand, which caused him to lose his head, and make him set up for what
      he called &ldquo;a gent.&rdquo; He built a lodge and a portico to Barley Hill Farm,
      rough cast, and put a pine roof on to the house, and then advertised in
      the &ldquo;Featherbedfordshire Gazette,&rdquo; that letters and papers were for the
      future to be addressed to John Hybrid, Esquire, Barley Hill Hall, and not
      Farm as they had hitherto been. And having done so much for the place,
      John next revised his own person, which, though not unsightly, was coarse,
      and a long way off looking anything like that of a gentleman. He first
      started the imperial aforesaid, and not being laughed at as much as he
      expected for that, he was emboldened to order a red coat for the then
      approaching season. Mounting the pink is a critical thing, for if a man
      does not land in the front rank they will not admit him again into the
      rear, and he remains a sort of red bat for the rest of his life,&mdash;neither
      a gentleman nor a farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, however, feeling that he had his lordship&rsquo;s countenance, went boldly
      at it, and the first day of the season before that with which we are
      dealing, found him with his stomach buttoned consequentially up in a spic
      and span scarlet with fancy buttons, looking as bumptious as a man with a
      large balance at his banker&rsquo;s. He sat bolt upright, holding his whip like
      a field-marshal&rsquo;s bâton, on his ill-groomed horse, with a tight-bearing
      rein chucking the Imperial chin well in the air, and a sort of
      half-defiant &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better not laugh at me&rdquo; look. And John was always
      proud to break a fence, or turn a hound, or hold a horse, or do anything
      his lordship bid him, and became a sort of hunting aide-de-camp to the
      great man. He was a boasting, bragging fool, always talking about m-o-y
      hall, and m-o-y lodge, and m-o-y plate in m-o-y drawing-room, for he had
      not discovered that plate was the appendage of a dining-room, and
      altogether he was very magnificent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperial Jane kept old Binks on the fret for some time, until another of
      his lordship&rsquo;s tenants, young Fred Poppyfield, becoming enamoured of her
      charms, and perhaps wishing to ride in scarlet too, sought her fair hand,
      whereupon his lordship, acting with his usual munificence, set them up on
      a farm at so low a rent that it acquired the name of Gift Hall Farm. This
      arrangement set Barley Hall free so far as the petticoats were concerned,
      and his lordship little knowing how well she was &ldquo;up&rdquo; in the country,
      thought this great gouk of a farmer, with his plate in his drawing-room,
      might come over the accomplished Miss de Glancey,&mdash;the lady who
      sneered at himself as &ldquo;a mere fox-hunter.&rdquo; And the wicked monkey favoured
      the delusion, which she saw through the moment his lordship brought the
      pompous egotist up at Newington Gorse, and begged to be allowed to
      introduce his friend, Mr Hybrid, and she inwardly resolved to give Mr.
      Hybrid a benefit. Forsaking his lordship therefore entirely, she put forth
      her most seductive allurements at Imperial John, talked most amazingly to
      him, rode over whatever he recommended, and seemed quite smitten with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And John, who used to boast that somehow the &ldquo;gals couldn&rsquo;t withstand
      him,&rdquo; was so satisfied with his success, that he presently blundered out
      an offer, when Miss de Glancey, having led him out to the extreme length
      of his tether, gave such a start and shudder of astonishment as Fanny
      Kemble, or Mrs. Siddons herself, might have envied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Mr. Hybrid! O, Mr. Hybrid!&rdquo; gasped she, opening wide her intelligent
      eyes, as if she had but just discovered his meaning. &ldquo;O, Mr. Hybrid!&rdquo;
       exclaimed she for the third time, &ldquo;<i>you&mdash;you&mdash;you</i>,&rdquo; and
      turning aside as if to conceal her emotion, she buried her face in her
      laced-fringed, richly-cyphered kerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      John, who was rather put out by some women who were watching him from the
      adjoining turnip-field, construing all this into the usual misfortune of
      the ladies not being able to withstand him, returned to the charge as soon
      as he got out of their hearing, when he was suddenly brought up by such a
      withering &ldquo;<i>Si-r-r-r! do you mean to insult me?</i>&rdquo; coupled with a look
      that nearly started the basket-buttons of his green cut-away, and
      convinced him that Miss de Glancey, at all events, could withstand him. So
      his Majesty slunk off, consoling himself with the reflection, that
      riding-habits covered a multitude of sins, and that if he was not much
      mistaken, she would want a deal of oil-cake, or cod liver oil, or summut
      o&rsquo; that sort, afore she was fit to show.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next time Miss met my lord (which, of course, she did by
      accident), she pouted and frowned at the &ldquo;mere fox-hunter,&rdquo; and intimated
      her intention of leaving the country&mdash;going home to her mamma, in
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at this juncture that Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s letter arrived, and his
      lordship&rsquo;s mind being distracted between love on his own account, dread of
      matrimony, and dislike of old Binks, he caught at what he would in general
      have stormed at, and wrote to say that he should begin hunting the first
      Monday in November, and if Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s son would come down a day or two
      before, he would &ldquo;put him up&rdquo; (which meant mount him), and &ldquo;do for him&rdquo;
       (which meant board and lodge him), all, in fact, that Mrs. Pringle could
      desire. And his lordship inwardly hoped that Mr. Pringle might be more to
      Miss de Glancey&rsquo;s liking than his Imperial Highness had proved. At all
      events, he felt it was but a simple act of justice to himself to try. Let
      us now return to Curtain Crescent.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E need not say
      that Mrs. Pringle was overjoyed at the receipt of the Earl&rsquo;s letter. It
      was so kind and good, and so like him. He always said he would do her a
      good turn if he could: but there are so many fine-weather friends in this
      world that there is no being certain of any one. Happy are they who never
      have occasion to test the sincerity of their friends, say we.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pringle was now all bustle and excitement, preparing Billy for the
      great event.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wardrobe, always grand, underwent revision in the undergarment line.
      She got him some magnificently embroidered dress shirts, so fine that the
      fronts almost looked as if you might blow them out, and regardful of the
      <i>rôle</i> he was now about to play, she added several dozen with horses,
      dogs, birds, and foxes upon them, &ldquo;suitable for fishing, shooting,
      boating, &amp;c.,&rdquo; as the advertisements said. His cambric kerchiefs were
      of the finest quality, while his stockings and other things were in great
      abundance, the whole surmounted by a splendid dressing-case, the like of
      which had ne&rsquo;er been seen since the days of Pea-Green Haine. Altogether he
      was capitally provided, and quite in accordance with a lady&rsquo;s-maid&rsquo;s ideas
      of gentility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, on his part, was active and energetic too, for though he had his
      doubts about being able to sit at the jumps, he had no objection to wear a
      red coat; and mysterious-looking boys, with blue bags, were constantly to
      be found seated on the mahogany bench, in the Curtain Crescent passage,
      waiting to try on his top boots; while the cheval glass up-stairs was
      constantly reflecting his figure in scarlet, <i>à la</i> Old Briggs. The
      concomitants of the chase, leathers, cords, whips, spurs, came pouring in
      apace. The next thing was to get somebody to take care of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is observable that the heads of the various branches of an
      establishment are all in favour of &ldquo;master&rdquo; spending all his money on
      their particular department. Thus, the coachman would have him run
      entirely to carriages, the groom to horses, the cook to the <i>cuisine</i>,
      the butler to wines, the gardener to grapes, &amp;c., and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pringle, we need hardly say, favoured lady&rsquo;s-maids and valets. It has
      been well said, that if a man wants to get acquainted with a gentleman&rsquo;s
      private affairs, he should either go to the lawyer or else to the valet
      that&rsquo;s courting the lady&rsquo;s-maid; and Mrs. Pringle was quite of that
      opinion. Moreover, she held that no man with an efficient, properly
      trained valet, need ever be catspawed or jilted, because the lady&rsquo;s-maid
      would feel it a point of honour to let the valet know how the land lay, a
      compliment he would return under similar circumstances. To provide Billy
      with this, as she considered, most essential appendage to a gentleman, was
      her next consideration&mdash;a valet that should know enough and not too
      much&mdash;enough to enable him to blow his master&rsquo;s trumpet properly, and
      not too much, lest he should turn restive and play the wrong tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she fixed upon the Anglo-Frenchman, whose name stands at the
      head of this chapter&mdash;Jean Rougier, or Jack Rogers. Jack was the son
      of old Jack Rogers, so well known as the enactor of the Drunken Huzzar,
      and similar characters of Nutkins&rsquo;s Circus; and Jack was entered to his
      father&rsquo;s profession, but disagreeing with the clown, Tom Oliver, who used
      to give him sundry most unqualified cuts and cuffs in the Circus, Jack,
      who was a tremendously strong fellow, gave Oliver such a desperate beating
      one night as caused his life to be despaired off. This took place at
      Nottingham, from whence Jack fled for fear of the consequences; and after
      sundry vicissitudes he was next discovered as a post-boy, at
      Sittingbourne, an office that he was well adapted for, being short and
      stout and extremely powerful. No brute was ever too bad for Jack&rsquo;s riding:
      he would tame them before the day was over. Somehow he got bumped down to
      Dover, when taking a fancy to go &ldquo;foreign,&rdquo; he sold his master&rsquo;s horses
      for what they would fetch; and this being just about the time that the
      late Mr. Probert expiated a similar mistake at the Old Bailey, Jack
      hearing of it, thought it was better to stay where he was than give Mr.
      Calcraft any trouble. He therefore accepted the situation of boots to the
      Albion Hotel, Boulogne-sur-mer; but finding that he did not get on half so
      well as he would if he were a Frenchman, he took to acquiring the
      language, which, with getting his ears bored, letting his hair and
      whiskers grow, and adopting the French costume in all its integrity,
      coupled with a liberal attack of the small-pox, soon told a tale in favour
      of his fees. After a long absence, he at length returned at the Bill Smith
      Revolution; and vacillating for some time between a courier and a valet,
      finally settled down to what we now find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know not how it is, if valets are so essentially necessary, that there
      should always be so many out of place, but certain it is that an
      advertisment in a morning paper will always bring a full crop to a door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, being the laziest of all lazy lives, any one can turn his hand to
      valeting, who to dig is unable, and yet to want is unwilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Pringle knew better than hold a levee in Curtain Crescent, letting
      all the applicants pump Properjohn or such of the maids as they could get
      hold of; and having advertised for written applications, stating full
      particulars of previous service, and credentials, to be addressed to F. P.
      at Chisel the baker&rsquo;s, in Yeast Street, she selected some half-dozen of
      the most promising ones, and appointed the parties to meet her, at
      different hours of course, at the first-class waiting-room of the great
      Western Station, intimating that they would know her by a bunch of red
      geraniums she would hold in her hand. And the second applicant, Jean
      Rougier, looked so like her money, having a sufficient knowledge of the
      English language to be able to understand all that was said, and yet at
      the same time sufficiently ignorant of it to invite confidential
      communications to be made before him; that after glancing over the
      testimonials bound up in his little parchment-backed passport book, she
      got the name and address of his then master, and sought an interview to
      obtain Monsieur&rsquo;s character. This gentleman, Sir Harry Bolter, happening
      to owe Jack three-quarters of a year&rsquo;s wages, which he was not likely to
      pay, spoke of him in the highest possible terms, glossing over his little
      partiality for drink by saying that, like all Frenchmen, he was of a
      convivial turn; and in consequence of Sir Harry&rsquo;s and Jack&rsquo;s own
      recommendations, Mrs. Pringle took him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will therefore now have the kindness to consider our hero and
      his valet under way, with a perfect pyramid of luggage, and Monsieur
      arrayed in the foraging cap, the little coatee, the petticoat trowsers,
      and odds and ends money-bag of his long adopted country, slung across his
      ample chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their arrival and reception at Tantivy Castle will perhaps be best
      described in the following letter from Billy to his mother:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tantivy Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dearest Mamma,
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>I write a line to say that I arrived here quite safe by the 5-30 train,
      and found the Earl as polite as possible. I should tell you that I made a
      mistake at starting, for it being dark when I arrived, and getting
      confused with a whole regiment of footmen, I mistook a fine gentleman who
      came forward to meet me for the Earl, and made him a most respectful bow,
      which the ass returned, and began to talk about the weather; and when the
      real Earl came in I took him for a guest, and was going to weather him.
      However he soon put all matters right, and introduced me to Mrs. Moffatt,
      a very fine lady, who seems to rule the roast here in grand style. They
      say she never wears the same dress twice.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>There are always at least half-a-dozen powdered footmen, in cerulean
      blue lined with rose-coloured silk, and pink silk stockings, the whole
      profusely illustrated with gold lace, gold aigulets, and I don&rsquo;t know
      what, lounging about in the halls and passages, wailing for company which
      Rougier says never comes. This worthy seems to have mastered the ins and
      outs of the place already, and says, &ldquo;my lor has an Englishman to cook his
      beef-steak for breakfast, a Frenchman to cook his dinner, and an Italian
      confectioner; every thing that a &lsquo;my lord&rsquo; ought to have&rdquo; It is a splendid
      place,&mdash;as you will see by the above picture, * more like Windsor
      than anything I ever saw, and there seems to be no expense spared that
      could by any possibility be incurred. I&rsquo;ve got a beautiful bedroom with
      warm and cold baths and a conservatory attached.</i>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* Our friend was writing on Castle-paper, of course.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>To-morrow is the first day of the season, and all the world and his
      wife will be there to a grand déjeuner à la Fourchette. The hounds meet
      before the Castle. His lordship says he will put me on a safe, steady
      hunter, and I hope he will, for I am not quite sure that I can sit at the
      jumps. However I&rsquo;ll let you know how I come on. Meanwhile as the gong is
      sounding for dressing, believe me, my dearest mamma,</i>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>EVERSING the usual
      order of things, each first Monday in November saw the sporting inmates of
      Tantivy Castle emerge from the chrysalis into the butterfly state of
      existence. His lordship&rsquo;s green-duck hunter and drab caps disappeared, and
      were succeeded by a spic-and-span span new scarlet and white top; Mr.
      Roggledike&rsquo;s last year&rsquo;s pink was replaced by a new one, his hat was
      succeeded by a cap; and the same luck attended the garments of both Swan
      and Speed. The stud-groom, the pad-groom, the sending-on groom, all the
      grooms down to our little friend, Cupid-without-Wings, underwent
      renovation in their outward men. The whole place smelt of leather and new
      cloth. The Castle itself on this occasion seemed to participate in the
      general festivity, for a bright sun emblazoned the quarterings of the
      gaily flaunting flag, lit up the glittering vanes of the lower towers, and
      burnished the modest ivy of the basements. Every thing was bright and
      sunny, and though Dicky Boggledike did not &ldquo;zactly like&rdquo; the red sunrise,
      he &ldquo;oped the rine might keep off until they were done, &lsquo;specially as it
      was a show day.&rdquo; Very showy indeed it was, for all the gentlemen out of
      livery,&mdash;those strange puzzlers&mdash;were in full ball costume;
      while the standard footmen strutted like peacocks in their rich blue
      liveries with rose-coloured linings, and enormous bouquets under their
      noses, feeling that for once they were going to have something to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noble Earl, having got himself up most elaborately in his new hunting
      garments, and effected a satisfactory tie of a heart&rsquo;s-ease embroidered
      blue satin cravat, took his usual stand before the now blazing wood and
      coal fire in the enormous grate in the centre of his magnificent baronial
      hall, ready to receive his visitors and pass them on to Mrs. Moffat in the
      banqueting room. This fair lady was just as fine as hands could make her,
      and the fit of her rich pale satin dress, trimmed with swan&rsquo;s-down,
      reflected equal credit on her milliner and her maid. Looking at her as she
      now sat at the head of the sumptuously-furnished breakfast table, her
      plainly dressed hair surmounted by a diminutive point-lace cap, and her
      gazelle-like eye lighting up an intelligent countenance, it were hardly
      possible to imagine that she had ever been handsomer, or that beneath that
      quiet aspect there lurked what is politely called a &ldquo;high spirit,&rdquo; that is
      to say, a little bit of temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      That however is more the Earl&rsquo;s look-out than ours, so we will return to
      his lordship at the entrance hall fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this sort of gathering was of rather an anomalous character,&mdash;some
      coming because they wanted something, some because they &ldquo;dirsn&rsquo;t&rdquo; stay
      away, some because they did not know Mrs. Moffat would be there, some
      because they did not care whether she was or not. It was a show day, and
      they came to see the beautiful Castle, not Mrs. Anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first to arrive were the gentlemen of the second class, the agents and
      dependents of the estate,&mdash;Mr. Cypher, the auditor, he who never
      audited; Mr. Easylease, the land agent; his son, Mr. John Easylease, the
      sucking land agent; Mr. Staple, the mining agent; Mr. James Staple, the
      sucking mining agent; Mr. Section, the architect; Mr. Pillerton, the
      doctor; Mr. Brick, the builder; &amp;c., who were all very polite ard
      obsequious, &ldquo;your lordship&rdquo; and my &ldquo;my lording&rdquo; the Earl at every
      opportunity. These, ranging themselves on either side of the fire, now
      formed the nucleus of the court, with the Earl in the centre.

    <p>
      Presently the rumbling of wheels and the grinding of gravel was succeeded
      by the muffled-drum sort of sound of the wood pavement of the grand
      covered portico, and the powdered footmen threw back the folding-doors as
      if they expected Daniel Lambert or the Durham Ox to enter. It was our old
      friend Imperial John, who having handed his pipeclayed reins to his
      ploughman-groom, descended from his buggy with a clumsy half buck, half
      hawbuck sort of air, and entered the spacious portals of the Castle hall.
      Having divested himself of his paletot in which he had been doing &ldquo;the
      pride that apes humility,&rdquo; he shook out his red feathers, pulled up his
      sea-green-silk-tied gills, finger-combed his stiff black hair, and stood
      forth a sort of rough impersonation of the last year&rsquo;s Earl. His coat was
      the same cut, his hat was the same shape, his boots and breeches were the
      same colour, and altogether there was the same sort of resemblance between
      John and the Earl that there is between a cart-horse and a race-horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having deposited his whip and paletot on the table on the door-side of a
      tall, wide-spreading carved oak screen, which at once concealed the
      enterers from the court, and kept the wind from that august assembly, John
      was now ready for the very obsequious gentleman who had been standing
      watching his performances without considering it necessary to give him any
      assistance. This bland gentleman, in his own blue coat with a white vest,
      having made a retrograde movement which cleared himself of the screen,
      John was presently crossing the hall, bowing and stepping and bowing and
      stepping as if he was measuring off a drain.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship, who felt grateful for John&rsquo;s recent services, and perhaps
      thought he might require them again, advanced to meet him and gave him a
      very cordial shake of the hand, as much as to say, &ldquo;Never mind Miss de
      Glancey, old fellow, we&rsquo;ll make it right another time.&rdquo; They then fell to
      conversing about turnips, John&rsquo;s Green Globes having turned out a splendid
      crop, while his Swedes were not so good as usual, though they still might
      improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more potent wheel-roll than John&rsquo;s now attracted his lordship&rsquo;s
      attention, and through the far windows he saw a large canary-coloured ark
      of a coach, driven by a cockaded coachman, which he at once recognised as
      belonging to his natural enemy Major Yammerton, &ldquo;five-and-thirty years
      master of haryers,&rdquo; as the Major would say, &ldquo;without a subscription.&rdquo; Mr.
      Boggledike had lately been regaling his lordship with some of the Major&rsquo;s
      boastings about his &ldquo;haryars&rdquo; and the wonderful sport they showed, which
      he had had the impudence to compare with his lordship&rsquo;s fox hounds.
      Besides which, he was always disturbing his lordship&rsquo;s covers on the
      Roughborough side of the country, causing his lordship to snub him at all
      opportunities. The Major, however, who was a keen, hard-bitten, little
      man, not easily choked off when he wanted anything, and his present want
      being to be made a magistrate, he had attired himself in an antediluvian
      swallow-tailed scarlet, with a gothic-arched collar, and brought his wife
      and two pretty daughters to aid in the design. Of course the ladies were
      only coming to see the Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cockaded coachman having tied his reins to the rail of the
      driving-box, descended from his eminence to release his passengers, while
      a couple of cerulean-blue gentlemen looked complacently on, each with half
      a door in his hand ready to throw open as they approached, the party were
      presently at the hall table, where one of those indispensable articles, a
      looking-glass, enabled the ladies to rectify any little derangement
      incidental to the joltings of the journey, while the little Major run a
      pocket-comb through a fringe of carroty curls that encircled his bald
      head, and disposed of a cream-coloured scarf cravat to what he considered
      the best advantage. Having drawn a doeskin glove on to the left hand, he
      offered his arm to his wife, and advanced from behind the screen with his
      hat in his ungloved right hand ready to transfer it to the left should
      occasion require.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah Major Yammerton!&rdquo; exclaimed the Earl, breaking off in the middle of
      the turnip dialogue with Imperial John. &ldquo;Ah, Major Yammerton, I&rsquo;m
      delighted to see you&rdquo; (getting a glimpse of the girls). &ldquo;Mrs. Yammerton,
      this is indeed extremely kind,&rdquo; continued he, taking both her hands in
      his; &ldquo;and bringing your lovely daughters,&rdquo; continued he, advancing to
      greet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Yammerton here gave the Major a nudge to remind him of his propriety
      speech. &ldquo;The gi&mdash;gi&mdash;girls and Mrs. Ya&mdash;Ya&mdash;Yammerton,&rdquo;
       for he always stuttered when he told lies, which was pretty often; &ldquo;the gi&mdash;gi&mdash;girls
      and Mrs. Ya&mdash;Ya&mdash;Yammerton have done me the honour&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another nudge from Mrs. Yammerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean to say the gi&mdash;gi&mdash;girls and Mrs. Ya&mdash;Ya&mdash;Yammerton,&rdquo;
       observed he, with a stamp of the foot and a shake of the head, for he saw
      that his dread enemy, Imperial John, was laughing at him, &ldquo;have done
      themselves the honour of co&mdash;co&mdash;coming, in hopes to be allowed
      the p&mdash;p&mdash;p&mdash;pleasure of seeing your mama&mdash;magnificent
      collection of pi&mdash;pi&mdash;pictors.&rdquo; the Major at length getting out
      what he had been charged to say.
    </p>

      &ldquo;By all means!&rdquo; exclaimed the delighted Earl, &ldquo;by all means; but first let
      me have the pleasure of conducting you to the refreshment-room;&rdquo; saying
      which his lordship offered Mrs. Yammerton his arm. So passing up the long
      gallery, and entering by the private door, he popped her down beside Mrs.
      Moffatt before Mrs. Yammerton knew where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then our friend Billy Pringle, who, with the aid of Rougier, had
      effected a most successful <i>logement</i> in his hunting things, made his
      appearance, to whom the Earl having assigned the care of the young ladies,
      now beat a retreat to the hall, leaving Mrs. Yammerton lost in
      astonishment as to what her Mrs. Grundy would say, and speculations as to
      which of her daughters would do for Mr. Pringle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperial John, who had usurped the Earl&rsquo;s place before the fire, now shied
      off to one side as his lordship approached, and made his most flexible
      obeisance to the two Mr. Fothergills and Mr. Stot, who had arrived during
      his absence. These, then, gladly passed on to the banqueting-room just as
      the Condor-like wings of the entrance hall door flew open and admitted
      Imperial Jane, now the buxom Mrs. Poppyfield. She came smiling past the
      screen, magnificently attired in purple velvet and ermine, pretending she
      had only come to warm herself at the &ldquo;&lsquo;All fire while Pop looked for the
      groom, who had brought his &lsquo;orse, and who was to drive her &lsquo;ome;&rdquo; but
      hearing from the Earl that the Yammertons were all in the banqueting-room,
      she saw no reason why she shouldn&rsquo;t go too; so when the next shoal of
      company broke against the screen, she took Imperial John&rsquo;s arm, and
      preceded by a cloud of lackeys, cerulean-blue and others, passed from the
      hall to the grand apartment, up which she sailed majestically, tossing her
      plumed head at that usurper Mrs. Moffatt; and then increased the kettle of
      fish poor Mrs. Yammerton was in by seating herself beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impudent woman,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Yammerton, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d had any idea of this I
      wouldn&rsquo;t have come;&rdquo; and she thought how lucky it was she had put the
      Major up to asking to see the &ldquo;pictors.&rdquo; It was almost a pity he was so
      anxious to be a magistrate. Thought he might be satisfied with being Major
      of such a fine regiment as the Featherbedfordshire Militia. Nor were her
      anxieties diminished by the way the girls took the words out of each
      other&rsquo;s mouths, as it were, in their intercourse with Billy Pringle, thus
      preventing either from making any permanent impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great flood of company now poured into the hall, red coats, green
      coats, black coats, brown coats, mingled with variously-coloured
      petticoats. The ladies of the court, Mrs. Cypher, Mrs. Pillerton, Mrs. and
      the Misses Easylease, Mrs. Section, and others, hurried through with a
      shivering sort of step as if they were going to bathe. Mr. D&rsquo;Orsay Davis,
      the &ldquo;we&rdquo; of the Featherbedfordshire Gazette, made his bow and passed on
      with stately air, as a ruler of the roast ought to do. The Earl of Stare,
      as Mr. Buckwheat was called, from the fixed protuberance of his eyes&mdash;a
      sort of second edition of Imperial John, but wanting his looks, and
      Gameboy Green, the hard rider of the hunt, came in together; and the Earl
      of Stare, sporting scarlet, advanced to his brother peer, the Earl, who,
      not thinking him an available card, turned him over to Imperial John who
      had now returned from his voyage with Imperial Jane, while his lordship
      commenced a building conversation with Mr. Brick.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lull then ensuing as if the door had done its duty, his lordship gave a
      wave of his hand, whereupon the trained courtiers shot out into horns on
      either side, with his lordship in the centre, and passed majestically
      along to the banqueting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noble apartment a hundred feet long, and correspondingly proportioned,
      was in the full swing of hospitality when the Earl entered. The great
      influx of guests for which the Castle was always prepared, had at length
      really arrived, and from Mrs. Moffatt&rsquo;s end of the table to the door, were
      continuous lines of party-coloured eaters, all engaged in the noble act of
      deglutition. Up the centre was a magnificent avenue of choice exotics in
      gold, silver, and china vases, alternating with sugar-spun Towers,
      Temples, Pagodas, and Rialtos, with here and there the more substantial
      form of massive plate, <i>èpergnes</i>, testimonials, and prizes of
      different kinds. It was a regular field day for plate, linen, and china.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole force of domestics was now brought to bear upon the charge, and
      the cerulean-blue gentlemen vied with the gentlemen out of livery in the
      assiduity of their attentions. Soup, game, tea, coffee, chocolate, ham,
      eggs, honey, marmalade, grapes, pines, melons, ices, buns, cakes, skimmed
      and soared, and floated about the room, in obedience to the behests of the
      callers. The only apparently disengaged person in the room, was Monsieur
      Jean Rougier, who, in a blue coat with a velvet collar and bright buttons,
      a rolling-collared white vest, and an amplified lace-tipped black
      Joinville, stood like a pouter pigeon behind Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s chair, the <i>beau
      ideal</i> of an indifferent spectator. And yet he was anything but an
      indifferent spectator; for beneath his stubbly hair were a pair of little
      roving, watchful eyes, and his ringed ears were cocked for whatever they
      could catch. The clatter, patter, clatter, patter of eating, which was
      slightly interrupted by the entrance of his lordship was soon in full
      vigour again, and all eyes resumed the contemplation of the plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, the &ldquo;fiz, pop, bang&rdquo; of a champagne cork was heard on the
      extreme right, which was immediately taken up on the left, and ran down
      either side of the table like gigantic crackers. Eighty guests were now
      imbibing the sparkling fluid, as fast as the footmen could supply it. And
      it was wonderful what a volubility that single glass a-piece (to be sure
      they were good large ones) infused into the meeting; how tongue-tied ones
      became talkative, and awed ones began to feel themselves sufficiently at
      home to tackle with the pines and sugar ornaments of the centre. Grottoes
      and Pyramids and Pagodas and Rialtos began to topple to their fall, and
      even a sugar Crystal Palace, which occupied the post of honour between two
      flower-decked Sèvres vases, was threatened with destruction. The band and
      the gardeners were swept away immediately, and an assault on the fountains
      was only prevented by the interference of Mr. Beverage, the butler. And
      now a renewed pop-ponading commenced, more formidable, if possible, than
      the first, and all glasses were eagerly drained, and prepared to receive
      the salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      All being ready, Lord Ladythorne rose amid the applause so justly due to a
      man entertaining his friends, and after a few prefatory remarks,
      expressive of the pleasure it gave him to see them all again at the
      opening of another season, and hoping that they might have many more such
      meetings, he concluded by giving as a toast, &ldquo;Success to fox-hunting!&rdquo;&mdash;which,
      of course, was drunk upstanding with all the honours.
    </p>
    <p>
      All parties having gradually subsided into their seats after this
      uncomfortable performance, a partial lull ensued, which was at length
      interrupted by his lordship giving Imperial John, who sat on his left, a
      nod, who after a loud throat-clearing <i>hem!</i> rose bolt upright with
      his imperial chin well up, and began, &ldquo;Gentlemen and Ladies!&rdquo; just as
      little weazeley Major Yammerton commenced &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen!&rdquo; from
      Mrs. Moffatt&rsquo;s end of the table. This brought things to a stand still&mdash;some
      called for Hybrid, some for Yammerton, and each disliking the other,
      neither was disposed to give way. The calls, however, becoming more
      frequent for Yammerton, who had never addressed them before, while Hybrid
      had, saying the same thing both times, the Earl gave his Highness a hint
      to sit down, and the Major was then left in that awful predicament, from
      which so many men would be glad to escape, after they have achieved it,
      namely,&mdash;the possession of the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Yammerton had got his speech well off, and had the heads of it
      under his plate; so on silence being restored, he thus went away with it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&mdash;(cough)&mdash;ladies and gentlemen,&mdash;(hem)
      I rise, I assure you&mdash;(cough)&mdash;with feelings of considerable
      trepidation&mdash;(hem)&mdash;to perform an act&mdash;(hem)&mdash;of
      greater difficulty than may at first sight appear&mdash;(hem, hem, haw)&mdash;for
      let me ask what it is I am about to do? (&ldquo;You know best,&rdquo; growled Imperial
      John, thinking how ill he was doing it.) I am going to propose the health
      of a nobleman&mdash;(applause)&mdash;of whom, in whose presence, if I say
      too much, I may offend, and if I say too little, I shall most justly
      receive your displeasure (renewed applause). But, ladies and gentlemen,
      there are times when the &lsquo;umblest abilities become equal to the occasion,
      and assuredly this is one&mdash;(applause). To estimate the character of
      the illustrious nobleman aright, whose health I shall conclude by
      proposing, we must regard him in his several capacities&mdash;(applause)&mdash;as
      Lord-Lieutenant of the great county of Featherbedford, as a great and
      liberal landlord, as a kind and generous neighbour, and though last, not
      least, as a brilliant sportsman&mdash;(great applause, during which
      Yammerton looked under his plate at his notes.)&mdash;As Lord-Lieutenant,&rdquo;
       continued he, &ldquo;perhaps the greatest praise I can offer him, the &lsquo;ighest
      compliment I can pay him, is to say that his appointments are so truly
      impartial as not to disclose his own politics&mdash;(applause)&mdash;as a
      landlord, he is so truly a pattern that it would be a mere waste of words
      for me to try to recommend him to your notice,&mdash;(applause)&mdash;as a
      neighbour, he is truly exemplary in all the relations of life,&mdash;(applause)&mdash;and
      as a sportsman, having myself kept haryers five-and-thirty years without a
      subscription, I may be permitted to say that he is quite first-rate,&mdash;(laughter
      from the Earl&rsquo;s end of the table, and applause from Mrs. Moffatt&rsquo;s.)&mdash;In
      all the relations of life, therefore, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo;&mdash;continued
      the Major, looking irately down at the laughers&mdash;&ldquo;I beg to propose
      the bumper toast of health, and long life to our &lsquo;ost, the noble Earl of
      Ladythorne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the little Major popped down on his chair, wondering whether he
      had omitted any thing he ought to have said, and seeing him well down,
      Imperial John, who was not to be done out of his show-off, rose, glass in
      hand, and exclaimed in a stentorian voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen and Ladies! Oi beg to propose that we drink this toast up
      standin&rsquo; with all the honours!&mdash;Featherbedfordshire fire!&rdquo; upon which
      there was a great outburst of applause, mingled with demands for wine, and
      requests from the ladies, that the gentlemen would be good enough to take
      their chairs off their dresses, or move a little to one side, so that they
      might have room to stand up; Crinoline, we should observe, being very
      abundant with many of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous discharge of popularity then ensued, the cheers being led by
      Imperial John, much to the little Major&rsquo;s chagrin, who wondered how he
      could ever have sat down without calling for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Earl, we should observe, had not risen in the best of moods that
      morning, having had a disagreeable dream, in which he saw old Binks riding
      his favourite horse Valiant, Mazeppa fashion, making a drag of his statue
      of the Greek slave, enveloped in an anise-seeded bathing-gown; a vexation
      that had been further increased when he arose, by the receipt of a letter
      from his &ldquo;good-natured friend&rdquo; in London, telling him how old Binks had
      been boasting at Boodle&rsquo;s that he was within an ace of an Earldom, and now
      to be clumsily palavered by Yammerton was more than he could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn&rsquo;t want to be praised for anything but his sporting propensities,
      and Imperial John knew how to do it. Having, however, a good dash of
      satire in his composition, when the applause and the Crinoline had
      subsided, he arose as if highly delighted, and assured them that if
      anything could enhance the pleasure of that meeting, it was to have his
      health proposed by such a sportsman as Major Yammerton, a gentleman who he
      believed had kept harriers five-and-thirty years, a feat he believed
      altogether unequalled in the annals of sporting&mdash;(laughter and
      applause)&mdash;during which the little Major felt sure he was going to
      conclude by proposing his health with all the honours, instead of which,
      however, his lordship branched off to his own department of sport, urging
      them to preserve foxes most scrupulously, never to mind a little poultry
      damage, for Mr. Boggledike would put all that right, never to let the
      odious word Strychnine be heard in the country, and concluded by proposing
      a bumper to their next merry meeting, which was the usual termination of
      the proceedings. The party then rose, chairs fell out of line, and flying
      crumpled napkins completed the confusion of the scene.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE day was quite
      at its best, when the party-coloured bees emerged from the sweets of
      Tantivy Castle, to taint the pure atmosphere with their nasty cigars, and
      air themselves on the terrace, letting the unadmitted world below see on
      what excellent terms they were with an Earl. Then Imperial John upbraided
      Major. Yammerton for taking the words out of his mouth, as it were, and
      the cockey Major turned up his nose at the &ldquo;farmer fellow&rdquo; for presuming
      to lector him. Then the emboldened ladies strolled through the
      picture-galleries and reception-rooms, regardless of Mrs. Moffatt or any
      one else, wondering where this door led to and where that. The hounds had
      been basking and loitering on the lawn for some time, undergoing the
      inspection and criticisms of the non-hunting portion of the establishment,
      the gardeners, the gamekeepers, the coachmen, the helpers, the housemaids,
      and so on. They all pronounced them as perfect as could be, and Mr.
      Hoggledike received their compliments with becoming satisfaction, saying,
      with a chuck of his chin, &ldquo;Yas, Yas, I think they&rsquo;re about as good as can
      be! Parfaction. I may say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having abused the cigars, we hope our fair friends will now excuse us for
      saying that we know of few less agreeable scenes than a show meet with
      fox-hounds. The whole thing is opposed to the wild nature of hunting. Some
      people can eat at any time, but to a well-regulated appetite, having to
      undergo even the semblance of an additional meal is inconvenient; while to
      have to take a <i>bonâ fide</i> dinner in the morning, soup, toast,
      speeches and all, is perfectly suicidal of pleasure. On this occasion, the
      wine-flushed guests seemed fitted for Cremorne or Foxhall, as they used to
      pronounce Vauxhall, than for fox-hunting. Indeed, the cigar gentry
      swaggered about with a very rakish, Regent Street air. His lordship alone
      seemed impressed with the importance of the occasion; but his anxiety
      arose from indecision, caused by the Binks&rsquo; dream and letter, and fear
      lest the Yammerton girls might spoil Billy for Miss de Glancey, should his
      lordship adhere to his intention of introducing them to each other. Then
      he began to fidget lest he might be late at the appointed place, and Miss
      de Glancey go home, and so frustrate either design.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>To horse! to horse!</i>&rdquo; therefore exclaimed he, now hurrying through
      the crowd, lowering his Imperial Jane-made hat-string, and drawing on his
      Moffatt-knit mits. &ldquo;<i>To horse! to horse!</i>&rdquo; repeated he, flourishing
      his cane hunting-whip, causing a commotion among the outer circle of
      grooms. His magnificent black horse, Valiant (the one he had seen old
      Binks bucketing), faultless in shape, faultless in condition, faultless
      every way, stepped proudly aside, and Cupid-without-Wings dropping himself
      off by the neck, Mr. Beanley, the stud groom, swept the coronetted rug
      over the horse&rsquo;s bang tail, as the superb and sensible animal stepped
      forward to receive his rider, as the Earl came up. With a jaunty air, the
      gay old gentleman vaulted lightly into the saddle, saying as he drew the
      thin rein, and felt the horse gently with his left leg, &ldquo;Now get Mr.
      Pringle his horse.&rdquo; His lordship then passed on a few paces to receive the
      sky-scraping salutes of the servants, and at a jerk of his head the
      cavalcade was in motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend Billy then became the object of attention. The dismounted Cupid
      dived into the thick of the led horses to seek his, while Mr. Beanley went
      respectfully up to him, and with a touch of his flat-brimmed hat,
      intimated that &ldquo;his oss was at &lsquo;and.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of an animal is it?&rdquo; asked the somewhat misgiving Billy, now
      bowing his adieus to the pretty Misses Yammerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very nice oss, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Beanley, with another touch of hat;
      &ldquo;yes, sir, a very nice oss&mdash;a perfect &lsquo;unter&mdash;nothin&rsquo; to do but
      sit still, and give &lsquo;im &lsquo;is &lsquo;ead, he&rsquo;ll take far better care o&rsquo; you than
      you can of &lsquo;im.&rdquo; So saying, Mr. Beanley led the way to a very
      sedate-looking, thorough-bred bay, with a flat flapped saddle, and a
      splint boot on his near foreleg, but in other respects quite
      unobjectionable. He was one of Swan&rsquo;s stud, but Mr. Beanley, understanding
      from the under butler, who had it from Jack Rogers&mdash;we beg his
      pardon,&mdash;Monsieur Rougier himself, that Mr. Pringle was likely to be
      a good tip, he had drawn it for him. The stirrups, for a wonder, being the
      right length, Billy was presently astride, and in pursuit of his now
      progressing lordship, the gaping crowd making way for the young lord as
      they supposed him to be&mdash;for people are all lords when they visit at
      lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pop, pop, bob, bob, went the black caps of the men in advance, indicating
      the whereabouts of the hounds, while his lordship ambled over the green
      turf on the right, surrounded by the usual high-pressure toadies. Thus the
      cavalcade passed through the large wood-studded, deer-scattered park,
      rousing the nearer herds from their lairs, frightening the silver-tails
      into their holes, and causing the conceited hares to scuttle away for the
      fern-browned, undulating hills, as if they had the vanity to suppose that
      this goodly array would condescend to have anything to do with them. Silly
      things! Peppercorn, the keeper, had a much readier way of settling their
      business. The field then crossed the long stretch of smooth, ornamental
      water, by the old gothic-arched bridge, and passed through the beautiful
      iron gates of the south lodge, now wheeled back by grey-headed porters, in
      cerulean-blue plush coats, and broad, gold-laced hats. Meanwhile, the
      whereabouts of the accustomed hunt was indicated by a lengthening line of
      pedestrians and small cavalry, toiling across the park by Duntler the
      watcher&rsquo;s cottage and the deer sheds, to the door in the wall at the
      bottom of Crow-tree hill, from whence a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the surrounding
      country is obtained. The piece had been enacted so often, the same
      company, the same day, the same hour, the same find, the same finish, that
      one might almost imagine it was the same fox On this particular occasion,
      however, as if out of pure contradiction, Master Reynard, by a series of
      successful manoeuvres, lying down, running a wall, popping backwards and
      forwards between Ashley quarries and Warmley Gorse, varied by an
      occasional trip to Crow-tree hill, completely baffled Mr. Boggledike, so
      that it was afternoon before he brought his morning fox to hand, to the
      great discomfort of the Earl, who had twice or thrice signaled Swan to
      &ldquo;who hoop&rdquo; him to ground, when the tiresome animal popped up in the midst
      of the pack. At length Boggledike mastered him; and after proclaiming him
      a &ldquo;cowardly, short-running dastardly traitor, no better nor a &lsquo;are,&rdquo; he
      chucked him scornfully to the hounds, decorating Master Pillerton&rsquo;s pony
      with the brush, while Swan distributed the pads among others of the rising
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last act of the &ldquo;show meet&rdquo; being thus concluded, Mr. Boggledike and
      his men quickly collected their hounds, and set off in search of fresh
      fields and pastures new.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl, having disposed of his show-meet fox&mdash;a bagman, of course&mdash;now
      set up his business-back, and getting alongside of Mr. Boggledike, led the
      pack at as good a trot as the hounds and the state of the line would
      allow. The newly laid whinstone of the Brittleworth road rather impeded
      their progress at first; but this inconvenience was soon overcome by the
      road becoming less parsimonious in width, extending at length to a grass
      siding, along which his lordship ambled at a toe in the stirrup trot, his
      eagle-eye raking every bend and curve, his mind distracted with visions of
      Binks, and anxiety for the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      He couldn&rsquo;t get over the dream, and the letter had anything but cheered
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;very odd,&rdquo; as nothing but drab-coated
      farmers and dark-coated grooms lounging leisurely &ldquo;on,&rdquo; with here and
      there a loitering pedestrian, broke the monotony of the scene. &ldquo;Hope she&rsquo;s
      not tired, and gone home,&rdquo; thought he, looking now at his watch, and now
      back into the crowd, to see where he had Billy Pringle. There was Billy
      riding alongside of Major Yammerton&rsquo;s old flea-bitten grey, whose rider
      was impressing Billy with a sense of his consequence, and the excellence
      of his &ldquo;haryers,&rdquo; paving the way for an invitation to Yammerton Grange. &ldquo;<i>D-a-ash</i>
      that Yammerton,&rdquo; growled his lordship, thinking how he was spoiling sport
      at both ends; at the Castle by his uninvited eloquence, and now by his
      fastening on to the only man in the field he didn&rsquo;t want him to get
      acquainted with. And his lordship inwardly resolved that he would make
      Easylease a magistrate before he would make the Major one. So settling
      matters in his own mind, he gave the gallant Valiant a gentle tap on the
      shoulder with his whip, and shot a few paces ahead of Dicky, telling the
      whips to keep the crowd off the hounds&mdash;meaning off himself. Thus he
      ambled on through the quiet little village of Strotherdale, whose
      inhabitants all rushed out to see the hounds pass, and after tantalising
      poor Jonathan Gape, the turnpike-gate man, at the far end, who thought he
      was going to get a grand haul, he turned short to the left down the
      tortuous green lane leading to Quarrington Gorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a footmark,&rdquo; said his lordship to himself, looking down at the
      now closely eaten sward. &ldquo;Ah! and there&rsquo;s a hat and feather,&rdquo; added he as
      a sudden turn of the lane afforded a passing glimpse. Thus inspirited, he
      mended his pace a little, and was presently in sight of the wearer. There
      was the bay, and there was the wide-awake, and there was the green
      trimming, and there was the feather; but somehow, as he got nearer, they
      all seemed to have lost <i>caste</i>. The slender waist and graceful
      upright seat had degenerated into a fuller form and lazy slouch; the habit
      didn&rsquo;t look like her habit, nor the bay horse like her bay horse, and as
      he got within speaking distance, the healthy, full-blown face of Miss
      Winkworth smiled upon him instead of the mild, placid features of the
      elegant de Glancey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Miss Winkworth!&rdquo; exclaimed his half-disgusted, half-delighted
      lordship, raising his hat, and then extending the right-hand of
      fellowship; &ldquo;Ah, my dear Miss Winkworth, I&rsquo;m charmed to see you&rdquo; (inwardly
      wondering what business women had out hunting). &ldquo;I hope you are all well
      at home,&rdquo; continued he (most devoutly wishing she was there); and without
      waiting for an answer, he commenced a furious assault upon Benedict, who
      had taken a fancy to follow him, a performance that enabled General
      Boggledike to come up with that army of relief, the pack, and engulf the
      lady in the sea of horsemen in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that had been <i>her</i>,&rdquo; said his lordship to himself, &ldquo;old Binks
      would have had a better chance;&rdquo; and he thought what an odious thing a bad
      copy was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Another bend of the land and another glimpse, presently put all matters
      right. The real feather now fluttered before him. There was the graceful,
      upright seat, the elegant air, the well-groomed horse, the <i>tout
      ensemble</i> being heightened, if possible, by the recent contrast with
      the coarse, country attired Miss Winkworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl again trotted gently on, raising his hat most deferentially as he
      came along side of her, as usual, unaverted head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, my Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed she gaily, as if agreeably surprised,
      tendering for the first time her pretty, little, primrose-coloured
      kid-gloved hand, looking as though she would condescend to notice a &ldquo;mere
      fox-hunter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gay old gentleman pressed it with becoming fervour, thinking he never
      saw her looking so well before.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then struck up a light rapid conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss perhaps never did look brighter or more radiant, and as his lordship
      rode by her side, he really thought if he could make up his mind to
      surrender his freedom to any woman, it would be to her. There was a
      something about her that he could not describe, but still a something that
      was essentially different to all his other flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never could bear a riding-woman before, but now he felt quite proud to
      have such an elegant, piquant attendant on his pack.&mdash;Should like, at
      all events, to keep her in the country, and enjoy her society.&mdash;Would
      like to add her to the collection of Featherbedfordshire witches of which
      his friends joked him in town.&mdash;&ldquo;Might have done worse than marry
      Imperial John,&rdquo; thought his lordship. John mightn&rsquo;t be quite her match in
      point of manner, but she would soon have polished him up, and John must be
      doing uncommonly well as times go&mdash;cattle and corn both selling
      prodigiously high, and John with his farm at a very low rent. And the
      thought of John and his beef brought our friend Billy to the Earl&rsquo;s mind,
      and after a sort of random compliment between Miss de Glancey and her
      horse, he exclaimed, &ldquo;By the way! I&rsquo;ve got a young friend out I wish to
      introduce to you,&rdquo; so rising in his saddle and looking back into the crowd
      he hallooed out, &ldquo;Pringle!&rdquo; a name that was instantly caught up by the
      quick-eared Dicky, a &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; tacked to it and passed backward to Speed,
      who gave it to a groom; and Billy was presently seen boring his way
      through the opening crowd, just as a shepherd&rsquo;s dog bores its way through
      a flock of sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pringle,&rdquo; said his lordship, as the approach of Billy&rsquo;s horse caused
      Valiant to lay back his ears, &ldquo;Pringle! I want to introduce you to Miss de
      Glancey, Miss de Glancey give me leave to introduce my friend Mr.
      Pringle,&rdquo; continued he, adding <i>soto voce</i>, as if for Miss de
      Glancey&rsquo;s ear alone, &ldquo;young man of very good family and fortune&mdash;<i>richest
      Commoner, in England, they say</i>.&rdquo; But before his lordship got to the
      richest Commoner part of his speech, a dark frown of displeasure had
      overcast the sweet smile of those usually tranquil features, which
      luckily, however, was not seen by Billy; and before he got his cap
      restored to his head after a sky scraping salute, Miss de Glancey had
      resumed her wonted complacency,&mdash;inwardly resolving to extinguish the
      &ldquo;richest Commoner,&rdquo; just as she had done his lordship&rsquo;s other &ldquo;friend Mr.
      Hybrid.&rdquo; Discarding the Earl, therefore, she now opened a most voluble
      battering on our good-looking Billy who, to do him justice, maintained his
      part so well, that a lady with less ambitious views might have been very
      well satisfied to be Mrs. Pringle. Indeed, when his lordship looked at the
      two chattering and ogling and simpering together, and thought of that
      abominable old Binks and the drag, and the letter from the Boodleite, his
      heart rather smote him for what he had done; for young and fresh as he
      then felt himself, he knew that age would infallibly creep upon him at
      last, just as he saw it creeping upon each particular friend when he went
      to town, and he questioned that he should ever find any lady so eminently
      qualified to do the double duty of gracing his coronet and disappointing
      the General. Not but that the same thought had obtruded itself with regard
      to other ladies; but he now saw that he had been mistaken with respect to
      all of them, and that this was the real, genuine, no mistake, &ldquo;right one.&rdquo;
       Moreover, Miss de Glancey was the only lady who according to his idea had
      not made up to him&mdash;rather snubbed him in fact. Mistaken nobleman!
      There are, many ways of making up to a man. But as with many, so with his
      lordship, the last run was always the finest, and the last lady always the
      fairest&mdash;the most engaging. With distracting considerations such as
      these, and the advantage of seeing Miss de Glancey play the artillery of
      her arts upon our young friend, they reached the large old pasture on the
      high side of Quarrington Gorse, a cover of some four acres in extent,
      lying along a gently sloping bank, with cross rides cut down to the brook.
      Mr. Boggledike pulled up near the rubbing-post in the centre of the field,
      to give his hounds a roll, while the second-horse gentlemen got their
      nags, and the new comers exchanged their hacks for their hunters. Judging
      by the shaking of hands, the exclamations of &ldquo;halloo! old boy is that
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say! where are you from?&rdquo; and similar inquiries, there were a good many
      of the latter&mdash;some who never went to the Castle, some who thought it
      too far, some who thought it poor fun. Altogether, when the field got
      scattered over the pasture, as a shop-keeper scatters his change on the
      counter, or as an old stage coachman used to scatter his passengers on the
      road with an upset, there might be fifty or sixty horsemen, assmen, and
      gigmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most conspicuous was his lordship&rsquo;s old eye-sore, Hicks, the flying hatter
      of Hinton (Sir Moses Mainchance&rsquo;s &ldquo;best man&rdquo;), who seemed to think it
      incumbent upon him to kill his lordship a hound every year by his reckless
      riding, and who now came out in mufti, a hunting-cap, a Napoleon-grey
      tweed jacket, loose white cords, with tight drab leggings, and spurs on
      his shoes, as if his lordship&rsquo;s hounds were not worth the green cut-a-way
      and brown boots he sported with Sir Moses. He now gave his cap-peak a sort
      of rude rap with his fore-finger, as his lordship came up, as much as to
      say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ll speak to you or not,&rdquo; and then ran his
      great raking chestnut into the crowd to get at his old opponent Gameboy
      Green, who generally rode for the credit of the Tantivy hunt. As these
      sort of cattle always hunt in couples, Hicks is followed by his shadow,
      Tom Snowdon, the draper&mdash;or the Damper, as he is generally called,
      from his unhappy propensity of taking a gloomy view of everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the right are a knot of half-horse, half-pony mounted Squireen-looking
      gentlemen, with clay pipes in their mouths, whose myrtle-green coats,
      baggy cords, and ill-cleaned tops, denote as belonging to the Major&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;haryers.&rdquo; And mark how the little, pompons man wheels before them, in
      order that Pringle may see the reverence they pay to his red coat. He
      raises his punt hat with all the dignity of the immortal Simpson of
      Vauxhall memory, and passes on in search of further compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship has now settled himself into the &ldquo;Wilkinson and Kidd&rdquo; of Rob
      Roy, a bay horse of equal beauty with Valiant, but better adapted to the
      country into which they are now going, Imperial John has drawn his girths
      with his teeth, D&rsquo;Orsay Davis has let down his hat-string, Mr. John
      Easylease has tightened his curb, Mr. Section drawn on his gloves, the
      Damper finished his cigar, and all things are approximating a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Elope, lads! Elope!</i>&rdquo; cries Dicky Boggledike to his hounds,
      whistling and waving them together, and in an instant the rollers and
      wide-spreaders are frolicking and chiding under his horse&rsquo;s nose. &ldquo;<i>G-e-e-ntly</i>,
      lads! <i>g-e-ently!</i>&rdquo; adds he, looking the more boisterous ones
      reprovingly in the face&mdash;&ldquo;gently lads, gently,&rdquo; repeats he, &ldquo;or
      you&rsquo;ll be rousin&rsquo; the gem&rsquo;lman i&rsquo; the gos.&rdquo; This movement of Dicky and the
      hounds has the effect of concentrating the field, all except our fair
      friend and Billy, who are still in the full cry of conversation, Miss
      putting forth her best allurements the sooner to bring Billy to book.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a chuck of his lordship&rsquo;s chin, Dicky turns his horse towards the
      gorse, just as Billy, in reply to Miss de Glancey&rsquo;s question, if he is
      fond of hunting, declares, as many a youth has done who hates it, that he
      &ldquo;doats upon it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A whistle, a waive, and a cheer, and the hounds are away. They charge the
      hedge with a crash, and drive into the gorse as if each hound had a bet
      that he would find the fox himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boggledike being now free of his pack, avails himself of this moment
      of ease, to exhibit his neat, newly clad person of which he is not a
      little proud, by riding along the pedestrian-lined hedge, and requesting
      that &ldquo;you fut people,&rdquo; as he calls them, &ldquo;will have the goodness not to
      &lsquo;alloa, but to &lsquo;old up your &lsquo;ats if you view the fox;&rdquo; and having
      delivered his charge in three several places, he turns into the cover by
      the little white bridle-gate in the middle, which Cupid-without-Wings is
      now holding open, and who touches his hat as Dicky passes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene is most exciting. The natural inclination of the land affords
      every one a full view of almost every part of the sloping, southerly-lying
      gorse, while a bright sun, with a clear, rarified atmosphere, lights up
      the landscape, making the distant fences look like nothing. Weak must be
      the nerves that would hesitate to ride over them as they now appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delusive view! Between the gorse and yonder fir-clad hills are two
      bottomless brooks, and ere the dashing rider reaches Fairbank Farm, whose
      tall chimney stands in bold relief against the clear, blue sky, lies a
      tract of country whose flat surface requires gulph-like drains to carry
      off the surplus water that rushes down from the higher grounds. To the
      right, though the country looks rougher, it is in reality easier, but
      foxes seem to know it, and seldom take that line; while to the left is a
      strongly-fenced country, fairish for hounds, but very difficult for
      horses, inasmuch as the vales are both narrow and deep. But let us find
      our fox and see what we can do among them. And as we are in for a burst,
      let us do the grand and have a fresh horse.

      CHAPTER XIII.<br/>GONE AWAY!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>EE! a sudden
      thrill shoots through the field, though not a hound has spoken; no, not
      even a whimper been heard. It is Speed&rsquo;s new cap rising from the dip of
      the ground at the low end of the cover, and now having seen the fox &ldquo;right
      well away,&rdquo; as he says, he gives such a ringing view halloa as startles
      friend Echo, and brings the eager pack pouring and screeching to the cry&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tweet! tweet! tweet!</i>&rdquo; now goes cantering Dicky&rsquo;s superfluous horn,
      only he doesn&rsquo;t like to be done out of his blow, and thinks the &ldquo;fut
      people&rdquo; may attribut&rsquo; the crash to his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes are now eagerly strained to get a view of old Reynard, some for
      the pleasure of seeing him, others to speculate upon whether they will
      have to take the stiff stake and rise in front, or the briar-tangled
      boundary fence below, in order to fulfil the honourable obligation of
      going into every field with the hounds. Others, again, who do not
      acknowledge the necessity, and mean to take neither, hold their horses
      steadily in hand, to be ready to slip down Cherry-tree Lane, or through
      West Hill fold-yard, into the Billinghurst turnpike, according as the line
      of chase seems to lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Talli-ho!</i>&rdquo; cries the Flying Hatter, as he views the fox whisking
      his brush as he rises the stubble-field over Fawley May Farm, and in an
      instant he is soaring over the boundary-fence to the clamorous pack just
      as his lordship takes it a little higher up, and lands handsomely in the
      next field. Miss de Glancey then goes at it in a canter, and clears it
      neatly, while Billy Pringle&rsquo;s horse, unused to linger, after waiting in
      vain for an intimation from his rider, just gathers himself together, and
      takes it on his own account, shooting Billy on to his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s off! no, he&rsquo;s on; he hangs by the mane!&rdquo; was the cry of the foot
      people, as Billy scrambled back into his saddle, which he regained with
      anything but a conviction that he could sit at the jumps. Worst of all, he
      thought he saw Miss de Glancey&rsquo;s shoulders laughing at his failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The privileged ones having now taken their unenviable precedence, the
      scramble became general, some going one way, some another, and the recent
      frowning fences are soon laid level with the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lucky lane running parallel with the line, along which the almost mute
      pack were now racing with a breast-high scent, relieved our friend Billy
      from any immediate repetition of the leaping inconvenience, though he
      could not hear the clattering of horses&rsquo; hoofs behind him without
      shuddering at the idea of falling and being ridden over. It seemed very
      different he thought to the first run, or to Hyde Park; people were all so
      excitcd, instead of riding quietly, or for admiration, as they do in the
      park. Just as Billy was flattering himself that the leaping danger was at
      an end, a sudden jerk of his horse nearly chucked him into Imperial John&rsquo;s
      pocket, who happened to be next in advance. The fox had been headed by the
      foot postman between Hinton and Sambrook; and Dicky Boggledike, after
      objurgating the astonished man, demanding, &ldquo;What the daval business he had
      there?&rdquo; had drawn his horse short across the lane, thus causing a sudden
      halt to those in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Flying Hatter and the Damper pressing close upon the pack as usual,
      despite the remonstrance of Gameboy Green and others, made them shoot up
      to the far-end of the enclosure, where they would most likely have topped
      the fence but for Swan and Speed getting round them, and adding the
      persuasion of their whips to the entreaties of Dicky&rsquo;s horn. The hounds
      sweep round to the twang, lashing and bristling with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Yo doit!</i>&rdquo; cries Dicky, as Sparkler and Pilgrim feather up the
      lane, trying first this side, then that. Sparkler speaks! &ldquo;He&rsquo;s across the
      lane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hoop! hoop! tallio! tallio!</i>&rdquo; cries Dicky cheerily, taking off his
      cap, and sweeping it in the direction the fox has gone, while his
      lordship, who has been bottling up the vial of his wrath, now uncorks it
      as he gets the delinquents within hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Hicks, for pressing on my hounds! Much obleged to you, Mr.
      Hicks, for pressing on my hounds! Hang you, Mr. Hicks, for pressing on my
      hounds!&rdquo; So saying, his lordship gathered Rob Roy together, and followed
      Mr. Boggledike through a very stiff bullfinch that Dicky would rather have
      shirked, had not the eyes of England been upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>S-w-ic-h!</i> Dicky goes through, and the vigorous thorns close again
      like a rat-trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me, my lord!&rdquo; exclaims Imperial John from behind, anxious to be
      conspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank &lsquo;e, no,&rdquo; replied his lordship, carelessly thinking it would not do
      to let Miss de Glancey too much into the secrets of the hunting field.
      &ldquo;Thank &lsquo;e, no,&rdquo; repeated he, and ramming his horse well at it, he gets
      through with little more disturbance of the thorns than Dicky had made.
      Miss de Glancey comes next, and riding quietly up the bank, she gives her
      horse a chuck with the curb and a touch with the whip that causes him to
      rise well on his haunches and buck over without injury to herself, her
      hat, or her habit. Imperial John was nearly offering his services to break
      the fence for her, but the &ldquo;<i>S-i-r-r!</i> do you mean to insult me?&rdquo;
       still tingling in his ears, caused him to desist. However he gives Billy a
      lift by squashing through before him, whose horse then just rushed through
      it as before, leaving Billy to take care of himself. A switched face was
      the result, the pain, however, being far greater than the disfigurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was going on above, D&rsquo;Orsay Davis, who can ride a spurt, has
      led a charge through a weaker place lower down; and when our friend had
      ascertained that his eyes were still in his head, he found two distinct
      lines of sportsmen spinning away in the distance as if they were riding a
      race. Added to this, the pent-up party behind him having got vent, made a
      great show of horsemanship as they passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; screamed one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look alive!&rdquo; shouted another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never say die!&rdquo; cried a third, though they were all as ready to shut up
      as our friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy&rsquo;s horse, however, not being used to stopping, gets the bit between
      his teeth, and scuttles away at a very overtaking pace, bringing him
      sufficiently near to let him see Gameboy Green and the Flying Hatter
      leading the honourable obligation van, out of whose extending line now a
      red coat, now a green coat, now a dark coat drops in the usual &ldquo;had
      enough&rdquo; style.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the ride-cunning, or know-the-country detachment, Miss de Glancey&rsquo;s
      flaunting habit, giving dignity to the figure and flowing elegance to the
      scene, might be seen going at perfect ease beside the noble Earl, who from
      the higher ground surveys Gameboy Green and the Hatter racing to get first
      at each fence, while the close-packing hounds are sufficiently far in
      advance to be well out of harm&rsquo;s way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;tch &rsquo;em, if you can!&rdquo; shrieks his lordship,
      eyeing their zealous endeavours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;tch &rsquo;em, if you can!&rdquo; repeats he, laughing, as
      the pace gets better and better, scarce a hound having time to give
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yooi, over he goes!&rdquo; now cries his lordship, as a spasmodic jerk of the
      leading hounds, on Alsike water meadow, turns Trumpeter&rsquo;s and Wrangler&rsquo;s
      heads toward the newly widened and deepened drain-cut, and the whole pack
      wheel to the left. What a scramble there is to get over! Some clear it,
      some fall back, while some souse in and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Gameboy, seeing by the newly thrown out gravel the magnitude of the
      venture, thrusts down his hat firmly on his brow, while Hicks gets his
      chesnut well by the head, and hardening their hearts they clear it in
      stride, and the Damper takes soundings for the benefit of those who come
      after. What a splash he makes!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the five-and-thirty years master of &ldquo;haryers&rdquo; without a
      subscription coming up, seeks to save the credit of his quivering-tailed
      grey by stopping to help the discontented Damper out of his difficulty,
      whose horse coming out on the wrong side affords them both a very fair
      excuse for shutting up shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the detachment, unwilling to bathe, after craning at the cut,
      scuttle away by its side down to the wooden cattle-bridge below, which
      being crossed, the honourable obligationers and the
      take-care-of-their-neckers are again joined in common union. It is,
      however, no time to boast of individual feats, or to inquire for absent
      friends, for the hounds still press on, though the pace is not quite so
      severe as it was. They are on worse soil, and the scent does not serve
      them so well. It soon begins to fail, and at length is carried on upon the
      silent system, and looks very like failing altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Boggledike, who has been riding as cunning as any one, now shows to
      the front, watching the stooping pack with anxious eye, lest he should
      have to make a cast over fences that do not quite suit his convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G&mdash;e&mdash;ntly, urryin&rsquo;! gently!&rdquo; cries he, seeing that a little
      precipitancy may carry them off the line. &ldquo;Yon cur dog has chased the fox,
      and the hounds are puzzled at the point where he has left him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sarr, what the daval business have you out with a dog on such an
      occasion as this?&rdquo; demands Dicky of an astonished drover who thought the
      road was as open to him as to Dicky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, sar! sar! you desarve to be put i&rsquo; the lock-up,&rdquo; continues Dicky, as
      the pack now divide on the scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, sar! sar! you should be chaasetised!&rdquo; added he, shaking his whip at
      the drover, as he trotted on to the assistance of the pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melody of the majority however recalls the cur-ites, and saves Dicky
      from the meditated assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the brief check was going on, his lordship was eyeing Miss de
      Glancey, thinking of all the quiet captivating women he had ever seen, she
      was the most so. Her riding was perfection, and he couldn&rsquo;t conceive how
      it was that he had ever entertained any objection to sports-women. It must
      have been from seeing some clumsy ones rolling about who couldn&rsquo;t ride;
      and old Binks&rsquo;s chance at that moment was not worth one farthing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Pringle?&rdquo; now asked his lordship, as the thought of Binks brought
      our hero to his recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down,&rdquo; replied Miss de Glancey carelessly, pointing to the ground with
      her pretty amethyst-topped whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down, is he!&rdquo; smiled the Earl, adding half to himself and half to her,
      &ldquo;thought he was a mull&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our friend indeed has come to grief. After pulling and hauling at his
      horse until he got him quite savage, the irritated animal, shaking his
      head as a terrier shakes a rat, ran blindfold into a bullfinch, shooting
      Billy into a newly-made manure-heap beyond. The last of the &ldquo;harryer&rdquo; men
      caught his horse, and not knowing who he belonged to, just threw the
      bridle-rein over the next gatepost, while D&rsquo;Orsay Davis, who had had
      enough, and was glad of an excuse for stopping, pulls up to assist Billy
      out of his dirty dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Augh, what a figure he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      But see! Mr. Boggledike is hitting off the scent, and the astonished
      drover is spurring on his pony to escape the chasetisement Dicky has
      promised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this critical moment, Miss de Glancey&rsquo;s better genius whispered her to
      go home. She had availed herself of the short respite to take a sly peep
      at herself in a little pocket-mirror she carried in her saddle, and found
      she was quite as much heated as was becoming or as could be ventured upon
      without detriment to her dress. Moreover, she was not quite sure but that
      one of her frizettes was coming out.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now when the hounds break out in fresh melody, and the Flying Hatter
      and Gameboy Green are again elbowing to the front, she sits reining in her
      steed, evidently showing she is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come along!&rdquo; exclaimed the Earl, looking back for her. &ldquo;Oh, come
      along,&rdquo; repeated he, waving her onward, as he held in his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting the appeal, for it was clear he would come back for
      her if she did, so touching her horse with the whip, she is again
      cantering by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give the world to see you beat that impudent ugly hatter,&rdquo; said he,
      now pointing Hicks out in the act of riding at a stiff newly-plashed fence
      before his hounds were half over.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his lordship spurred his horse as he spoke with a vigour that spoke
      the intensity of his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line of chase then lay along the swiftly flowing Arrow banks and
      across Oxley large pastures, parallel with the Downton bridle-road, along
      which Dicky and his followers now pounded; Dicky hugging himself with the
      idea that the fox was making for the main earths on Bringwood moor, to
      which he knew every yard of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the fox was going as straight and as hard as ever he could, but as
      ill luck would have it, young Mr. Nailor, the son of the owner of Oxley
      pastures, shot at a snipe at the west corner of the large pasture just as
      pug entered at the east, causing him to shift his line and thread
      Larchfield plantations instead of crossing the pasture, and popping down
      Tillington Dean as he intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dicky had heard the gun, and the short turn of the hounds now showing him
      what had happened, he availed himself of the superiority of a well-mounted
      nobleman&rsquo;s huntsman in scarlet over a tweed-clad muffin-capped shooter,
      for exclaiming at the top of his voice as he cantered past, horn in hand,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ye poachin&rsquo; davil, what business &lsquo;ave ye there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ye nasty sneakin&rsquo; snarin&rsquo; ticket-o&rsquo;-leaver, go back to the place from
      whance you came!&rdquo; leaving the poor shooter staring with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      A twang of the horn now brings the hounds&mdash;who have been running with
      a flinging catching side-wind scent on to the line, and a full burst of
      melody greets the diminished field, as they strike it on the bright grass
      of the plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For&mdash;rard! for&mdash;rard!&rdquo; is the cry, though there isn&rsquo;t a hound
      but what is getting on as best as he can.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merry music reanimates the party, and causes them to press on their
      horses with rather more freedom than past exertions warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperial John&rsquo;s is the first to begin wheezing, but his Highness feeling
      him going covers a retreat of his hundred-and-fifty-guineas-worth, as he
      hopes he will be, under shelter of the plantation.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ****
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the &lsquo;atter&rsquo;s oss has about &lsquo;ad enough,&rdquo; now observes Dicky to his
      lordship, as he holds open the bridle-gate at the end of the plantation
      into the Benington Lane for his lordship and Miss de Glancey to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad of it,&rdquo; replied the Earl, thinking the Hatter would not be able to
      go home and boast how he had cut down the Tantivy men and hung them up to
      dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old &lsquo;ard, one moment!&rdquo; now cries Dicky, raising his right hand as the
      Hatter comes blundering through the quickset fence into the hard lane, his
      horse nearly alighting on his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old &lsquo;ard, please!&rdquo; adds he, as the Hatter spurs among the road-stooping
      pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooick to Challenger! Hooick to Challenger!&rdquo; now holloas Dicky, as
      Challenger, after sniffing up the grassy mound of the opposite hedge,
      proclaims that the fox is over; and Dicky getting his horse short by the
      head, slips behind the Hatter&rsquo;s horse&rsquo;s tail for his old familiar friend
      the gap in the corner, while the Hatter gathers his horse together to
      fulfil the honourable obligation of going with the hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C&mdash;u&mdash;r&mdash;m up!&rdquo; cries he, with an <i>obligato</i>
      accompaniment of the spur rowels, which the honest beast acknowledges by a
      clambering flounder up the bank, making the descent on his head on the
      field side that he nearly executed before. The Hatter&rsquo;s legs perform a
      sort of wands of a mill evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not hurt, I hope!&rdquo; holloas the Earl, who with Miss de Glancey now lands a
      little above, and seeing the Hatter rise and shake himself he canters on,
      giving Miss de Glancey a touch on the elbow, and saying with a knowing
      look, &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s capital!</i> get rid of him, leggings and all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lordship having now seen the last of his tormentors, has time to look
      about him a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been a monstrous fine run,&rdquo; observes he to the lady, as they canter
      together behind the pace-slackening pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monstrous,&rdquo; replies the lady, who sees no fun in it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has it been?&rdquo; asks his lordship of Swan, who now shows to the
      front as a whip-aspiring huntsman is wont to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour all but five minutes, my lord,&rdquo; replies the magnifier, looking at
      his watch. &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;an hour &lsquo;zactly, my lord,&rdquo; adds he, trotting
      on&mdash;restoring his watch to his fob as he goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour best pace with but one slight check&mdash;can&rsquo;t have come less
      than twelve miles,&rdquo; observes his lordship, thinking it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied Miss de Glancey, wishing it was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand sport fox-hunting, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked his lordship, edging close up
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charming!&rdquo; replied Miss de Glancey, feeling her failing frizette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effervescence of the thing is now about over, and the hounds are
      reduced to a very plodding pains-taking pace. The day has changed for the
      worse, and heavy clouds are gathering overhead. Still there is a good
      holding scent, and as the old saying is, a fox so pressed must stop at
      last, the few remaining sportsmen begin speculating on his probable
      destination, one backing him for Cauldwell rocks, another for Fulford
      woods, a third for the Hawkhurst Hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Awk&rsquo;urst &lsquo;ills for a sovereign!&rdquo; now cries Dicky, hustling his horse,
      as, having steered the nearly mute pack along Sandy-well banks, Challenger
      and Sparkler strike a scent on the track leading up to Sorryfold Moor, and
      go away at an improving pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Awk&rsquo;urst &lsquo;ills for a fi&rsquo;-pun note!&rdquo; adds he, as the rest of the pack
      score to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to have rine!&rdquo; now observes he, as a heavy drop beats upon his
      up-turned nose. At the same instant a duplicate drop falls upon Miss de
      Glancey&rsquo;s fair cheek, causing her to wish herself anywhere but where she
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another, and another, and another, follow in quick succession, while the
      dark, dreary moor offers nothing but the inhospitable freedom of space.
      The cold wind cuts through her, making her shudder for the result. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
      for the hills!&rdquo; exclaims Gameboy Green, still struggling on with a
      somewhat worse-for-wear looking steed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s for the hills!&rdquo; repeats he, pointing to a frowning line in the misty
      distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same instant his horse puts his foot in a stone-hole, and Gameboy
      and he measure their lengths on the moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That comes of star-gazing,&rdquo; observed his lordship, turning his
      coat-collar up about his ears. &ldquo;That comes of star-gazing,&rdquo; repeats he,
      eyeing the loose horse scampering the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see no more of him,&rdquo; observed Miss de Glancey, wishing she was as
      well out of it as Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not likely, I think,&rdquo; replied his lordship, seeing the evasive rush the
      horse gave, as Speed, who was coming up with some tail hounds, tried to
      catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heath-brushing fox leaves a scent that fills the painfully still
      atmosphere with the melody of the hounds, mingled with the co-beck&mdash;co-beck&mdash;co-beck
      of the startled grouse. There is a solemn calm that portends a coming
      storm. To Miss de Clancey, for whom the music of the hounds has no charms,
      and the fast-gathering clouds have great danger, the situation is
      peculiarly distressing. She would stop if she durst, but on the middle of
      a dreary moor how dare she.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ominous gusty wind, followed by a vivid flash of lightning and a
      piercing scream from Miss de Glancey, now startled the Earl&rsquo;s meditations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lightning!&rdquo; exclaimed his lordship, turning short round to her
      assistance. &ldquo;Lightning in the month of November&mdash;never heard of such
      a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But ere his lordship gets to Miss de Glancey&rsquo;s horse, a most terrific clap
      of thunder burst right over head, shaking the earth to the very centre,
      silencing the startled hounds, and satisfying his lordship that it <i>was</i>
      lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another flash, more vivid if possible than the first, followed by another
      pealing crash of thunder, more terrific than before, calls all hands to a
      hurried council of war on the subject of shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must make for the Punch-bowl at Rockbeer,&rdquo; exclaims General
      Boggledike, flourishing his horn in an ambiguous sort of way, for he
      wasn&rsquo;t quite sure he could find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> know the Punch-bowl at Rockbeer!&rdquo; shouts he to Harry Swan,
      anxious to have some one on whom to lay the blame if he went wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it when I&rsquo;m there,&rdquo; replied Swan, who didn&rsquo;t consider it part of
      his duty to make imaginary runs to ground for his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know it when you&rsquo;re there, man,&rdquo; retorted Dicky in disgust; &ldquo;why any&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       the remainder of his sentence being lost in a tremendously illuminating
      flash of lightning, followed by a long cannonading, reverberating roll of
      thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Miss de Glancey was ready to sink into the earth.

      &ldquo;<i>Elope, hounds! elope!</i>&rdquo; cried Dicky, getting his horse short by the
      head, and spurring him into a brisk trot. &ldquo;<i>Elope, hounds! elope!</i>&rdquo;
       repeated he, setting off on a speculative cast, for he saw it was no time
      for dallying.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;From cloud to cloud the rending lightnings rage;
Till in the furious elemental war
Dissolved, the whole precipitated mass,
Unbroken floods and solid torrents pour.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Luckily for Dicky, an unusually vivid flash of lightning so lit up the
      landscape as to show the clump of large elms at the entrance to Rockbeer;
      and taking his bearings, he went swish swash, squirt spurt, swish swash,
      squirt spurt, through the spongy, half land, half water moor, at as good a
      trot as he could raise. The lately ardent, pressing hounds follow on in
      long-drawn file, looking anything but large or formidable. The frightened
      horses tucked in their tails, and looked fifty per cent. worse for the
      suppression. The hard, driving rain beats downways, and sideways, and
      frontways, and backways&mdash;all ways at once. The horses know not which
      way to duck, to evade the storm. In less than a minute Miss de Glancey is
      as drenched as if she had taken a shower-bath. The smart hat and feathers
      are annihilated; the dubious frizette falls out, down comes the hair; the
      bella-donna-inspired radiance of her eyes is quenched; the Crinoline and
      wadding dissolve like ice before the fire; and ere the love-cured Earl
      lifts her off her horse at the Punch-bowl at Rockbeer, she has no more
      shape or figure than an icicle. Indeed she very much resembles one, for
      the cold sleet, freezing as it fell, has encrusted her in a rich coat of
      ice lace, causing her saturated garments to cling to her with the utmost
      pertinacity. A more complete wreck of a belle was, perhaps, never seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What an object!</i>&rdquo; inwardly ejaculated she, as Mrs. Hetherington,
      the landlady, brought a snivelling mould candle into the cheerless,
      fireless little inn-parlour, and she caught a glimpse of herself in the&mdash;at
      best&mdash;most unbecoming mirror. What would she have given to have
      turned back!
    </p>
    <p>
      And as his lordship hurried up stairs in his water-logged boots, he said
      to himself, with a nervous swing of his arm, &ldquo;I was right!&mdash;women <i>have</i>
      no business out hunting.&rdquo; And the Binks chance improved amazingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The further <i>denouement</i> of this perishing day will be gleaned from
      the following letters.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.<br/>THE PRINGLE CORRESPONDENCE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MR WILLIAM TO HIS MAMMA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tantivy Castle, November.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Mamma,
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Though I wrote to you only the other day, I take up my pen, stiff and
      sore as I am and scarcely able to sit, to tell you of my first day&rsquo;s hunt,
      which, I assure you, was anything but enjoyable. In fact, at this moment I
      feel just as if I had been thumped by half the pugilists in London and
      severely kicked at the end. To my fancy, hunting is about the most
      curious, unreasonable amusement that ever was invented. The first fox was
      well enough, running backwards and forwards in an agreeable manner, though
      they all abused him and called him a cowardly beggar, though to my mind it
      was far pluckier to do what he did, with fifty great dogs after him, than
      to fly like a thief as the next one did. Indeed I saw all the first run
      without the slightest inconvenience or exertion, for a very agreeable
      gentleman, called Major Hammerton, himself an old keeper of hounds, led me
      about and showed me the country.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to say that he led my horse, but he showed me the way to
      go, so as to avoid the jumps, and pointed out the places where I could get
      a peep of the fox. I saw him frequently. The Major, who was extremely
      polite, asked me to go and stay with him after I leave here, and I
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind going if it wasn&rsquo;t for the hounds, which, however, he says
      are quite as fine as his lordship&rsquo;s, without being so furiously and
      inconveniently fast. For my part, however, I don&rsquo;t see the use of hunting
      an animal that you can shoot, as they do in France. It seems a monstrous
      waste of exertion. If they were all as sore as I am this morning, I&rsquo;m sure
      they wouldn&rsquo;t try it again in a hurry. I really think racing, where you
      pay people for doing the dangerous for you, is much better fun, and
      prettier too, for you can choose any lively colour you like for your
      jacket, instead of having to stick to scarlet or dark clothes.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;But I will tell you about fox No. 2. I was riding with a very pretty
      young lady, Miss de Glancey, whom the Earl had just introduced me to, when
      all of a sudden everybody seemed to be seized with an uncontrollable
      galloping mania, and set off as hard as ever their horses could lay legs
      to the ground. My horse, who they said was a perfect hunter, but who, I
      should say, was a perfect brute, partook of the prevailing epidemic, and,
      though he had gone quite quietly enough before, now seized the bit between
      his teeth, and plunged and reared as though he would either knock my teeth
      down my throat, or come back over upon me. &lsquo;Drop your hand!&rsquo; cried one.
      &lsquo;Ease his head!&rsquo; cried another, and what was the consequence? He ran away
      with me and, dashing through a flock of turkeys, nearly capsized an old
      sow.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Then the people, who had been so civil before, all seemed to be seized
      with the rudes. It was nothing but &lsquo;g-u-u-r along, sir! g-u-u-r along!
      Hang it! don&rsquo;t you see the hounds are running!&rsquo; just as if I had made them
      run, or as if I could stop them. My good friend, the Major, seemed to be
      as excited as any body: indeed, the only cool person was Miss de Glancey,
      who cantered away in a most unconcerned manner. I am sorry to say she came
      in for a desperate ducking. It seems that after I had had as much as I
      wanted, and pulled up to come home, they encountered a most terrific
      thunder-storm in crossing some outlandish moor, and as his lordship, who
      didn&rsquo;t get home till long after dark, said she all at once became a
      dissolving view, and went away to nothing. Mrs. Moffatt, who is stout and
      would not easily dissolve, seemed amazingly tickled with the joke, and
      said she supposed she would look like a Mermaid&mdash;which his lordship
      said was exactly the case. When the first roll of thunder was heard here,
      the Earl&rsquo;s carriage and four was ordered out, with dry things, to go in
      quest of him; but they tried two of his houses of call before they fell in
      with him. It then had to return to take the Mermaid to her home, who had
      to borrow the publican&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s Sunday clothes to travel in.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;After dinner, the stud-groom came in to announce the horses for
      to-day; and hearing one named for me, I begged to decline the honour, on
      the plea of having a great many letters to write, so Mrs. Moffatt
      accompanied his lordship to the meet, some ten miles north of this, in his
      carriage and four, from whence she has just returned, and says they went
      away with a brilliant scent from Foxlydiate Gorse, meaning, I presume,
      with another such clatter as we had yesterday. I am glad I didn&rsquo;t go, for
      I don&rsquo;t think I could have got on to a horse, let alone sit one,
      especially at the jumps, which all the Clods in the country seem to have
      clubbed their ideas to concoct. Rougier says people are always stiff after
      the first day&rsquo;s hunting; but if I had thought I should be as sore and
      stiff as I am, I don&rsquo;t think I would ever have taken a day, because Major
      Hammerlon says it is not necessary to go out hunting in the morning to
      entitle one to wear the dress uniform in the evening&mdash;which is really
      all I care for.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;The servants here seem to live like fighting-cocks, from Rougier&rsquo;s
      account; breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, teas, and suppers. They sit down,
      ten or a dozen at the second table, and about thirty or so in the hall,
      besides which there are no end of people out of doors. Rougier says they
      have wine at the second table, and eau de vie punch at night at
      discretion, of which, I think, he takes more than is discreet, for he came
      swaggering into my room at day-break this morning, in his evening dress,
      with his hat on, and a great pewter inkstand in his hand, which he set
      down on the dressing-table, and said, &lsquo;dere, sir, dere is your shavin&rsquo; 
      water!&rsquo; Strange to say, the fellow speaks better English when he&rsquo;s drunk
      than he does when he&rsquo;s sober. However, I suppose I must have a valet,
      otherwise I should think it would be a real kindness to give the great
      lazy fellows here something to do, other than hanging about the passages
      waylaying the girls, I&rsquo;ll write you again when I know what I&rsquo;m going to
      do, but I don&rsquo;t think I shall stay here much longer, if I&rsquo;m obliged to
      risk my neck after these ridiculous dogs. Ever, my dearest Mamma your most
      affectionate, but excruciatingly sore, son.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wm. PRINGLE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following is Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s answer; who, it will be seen, received
      Billy&rsquo;s last letter while she was answering his first one:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;25, Curtain Crescent, &ldquo;Belgrave Square, London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own dearest William,
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I was overjoyed, my own darling, to receive your kind letter, and hear
      that you had arrived safe, and found his lordship so kind and agreeable. I
      thought you had known him by sight, or I would have prevented your making
      the mistake by describing him to you. However, there is no harm done. In a
      general way, the great man of the place is oftentimes the least.&mdash;The
      most accessible, that is to say. The Earl is an excellent, kind-hearted
      man, and it will do you great good among your companions to be known to be
      intimate with him, for I can assure you it is not every one he takes up
      with. Of course, there are people who abuse him, and say he is this and
      that, and so on; but you must take people&mdash;especially great ones&mdash;as
      you find them in this world; and he is quite as good as his whites of
      their eyes turning-up neighbours. Don&rsquo;t, however presume on his kindness
      by attempting to stay beyond what he presses you to do, for two short
      visits tell better than one long one, looking as though you had been
      approved of. You can easily find out from the butler or the groom of the
      chambers, or some of the upper servants, how long you are expected to
      stay, or perhaps some of the guests can tell you how long they are invited
      for.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I had written thus far when your second welcome letter arrived, and I
      can&rsquo;t tell you how delighted I am to hear you are safe and well, though
      I&rsquo;m sorry to hear you don&rsquo;t like hunting, for I assure you it is the best
      of all possible sports, and there is none that admits of such elegant
      variety of costume.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Look at a shooter,&mdash;what a ragamuffin dress his is, hardly
      distinguishable from a keeper; and yachters and cricketers might be taken
      for ticket-of-leave men. I should be very sorry indeed if you were not to
      persevere in your hunting; for a red coat and leathers are quite your
      become, and there is none, in my opinion, in which a gentleman looks so
      well, or a snob so ill. Learning to hunt can&rsquo;t be more disagreeable than
      learning to sail or to smoke, and see how many hundreds&mdash;thousands I
      may say&mdash;overcome the difficulty every year, and blow their clouds,
      as they call them, on the quarterdeck, as though they had been born
      sailors with pipes in their mouths. Remember, if you can&rsquo;t manage to sit
      your horse, you&rsquo;ll be fit for nothing but a seat in Parliament along with
      Captain Catlap and the other incurables. I can&rsquo;t think there can be much
      difficulty in the matter, judging from the lumpy wash-balley sort of men
      one hears talking about it. I should think if you had a horse of your own,
      you would be able to make better out. Whatever you do, however, have
      nothing to do with racing. It&rsquo;s only for rogues and people who have more
      money than they know what to do with, and to whom it doesn&rsquo;t matter
      whether they win or they lose. We musn&rsquo;t have you setting up a
      confidential crossing-sweeper with a gold eyeglass. No gentleman need
      expect to make money on the turf, for if you were to win they wouldn&rsquo;t pay
      you, whereas, if you lose it&rsquo;s quite a different thing. One of the
      beauties of hunting is that people have no inducement to poison each
      other; whereas in racing, from poisoning horses they have got to poisoning
      men, besides which one party must lose if the other is to win. Mutual
      advantage is impossible. Another thing, if you were to win ever so, the
      trainer would always keep his little bill in advance of your gains, or he
      would be a very bad trainer.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I hope Major Hammerton is a gentleman of station, whose acquaintance
      will do you good, though the name is not very aristocratic&mdash;Hamilton
      would have been better. Are there any Miss H&rsquo;s? Remember there are always
      forward people in the world, who think to advance themselves by taking
      strangers by the hand, and that a bad introduction is far worse than none.
      Above all, never ask to be introduced to a great man. Great people have
      their eyes and ears about them just as well as little ones, and if they
      choose to know you, they will make the advance. Asking to be introduced
      only prejudices them against you, and generally insures a cut at the first
      opportunity.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Beware of Miss de Glancey. She is a most determined coquette, and if
      she had fifty suitors, wouldn&rsquo;t be happy if she saw another woman with
      one, without trying to get him from her. She hasn&rsquo;t a halfpenny. If you
      see her again, ask her if she knows Mr. Hotspur Smith, or Mr. Enoch
      Benson, or Mr. Woodhorn, and tell me how she looks. What is she doing down
      there? Surely she hasn&rsquo;t the vanity to think she can captivate the Earl.
      You needn&rsquo;t mention me to Mrs. Moffatt, but I should like to know what she
      has on, and also if there are any new dishes for dinner. Indeed, the less
      you talk about your belongings the better; for the world has but two ways,
      that of running people down much below their real level, or of extolling
      them much beyond their deserts. Remember, well-bred people always take
      breeding for granted, &lsquo;one of us,&rsquo; as they say in others when they find
      them at good houses, and as you have a good name, you have nothing to do
      but hold your tongue, and the chances are they will estimate you at far
      more than your real worth.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;A valet is absolutely indispensable for a young gentleman. Bless you!
      you would be thought nothing of among the servants if you hadn&rsquo;t one. They
      are their masters&rsquo; trumpeters. A valet, especially a French one, putting
      on two clean shirts a day, and calling for Burgundy after your cheese, are
      about the most imposing things in the lower regions. In small places,
      giving as much trouble as possible, and asking for things you think they
      haven&rsquo;t got, is very well; but this will not do where you now are. In a
      general way, it is a bad plan taking servants to great houses, for, as
      they all measure their own places by the best they have ever seen, and
      never think how many much worse ones there are, they come back
      discontented, and are seldom good for much until they have undergone a
      quarter&rsquo;s starving or so, out of place. It is a good thing when the great
      man of a country sets an example of prudence and economy, for then all
      others can quote him, instead of having the bad practices of other places
      raked up as authority for introducing them into theirs. The Earl, however,
      would never be able to get through half his income if he was not to wink
      at a little prodigality, and the consumption of wine in great houses would
      be a mere nothing if it was not for the assistance of the servants.
      Indeed, the higher you get into society, the less wine you get, until you
      might expect to see it run out to nothing at a Duke&rsquo;s. I dare say Rougier
      will be fond of drink, and the English servants will perhaps be fond of
      plying him with it; but, so long as he does not get incompetent, a little
      jollity on his part will make them more communicative before him, and it
      is wonderful what servants can tell. They know everything in the kitchen&mdash;nothing
      in the parlour. His lordship, I believe, doesn&rsquo;t allow strange servants to
      wait except upon very full occasions, otherwise it might be well to put
      Rougier under the surveillance of Beverage, the butler, lest he should
      come into the room drunk and incompetent, which would be very
      disagreeable.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I enclose you a gold fox-head pin to give Mr. Boggledike, who doesn&rsquo;t
      take money, at least nothing under £5, and this only costs 18s. He is a
      favourite with his lordship, and it will be well to be in with him. You
      had better give the men who whip the hounds a trifle, say 10s. or
      half-a-sovereign each&mdash;gold looks better than silver. If you go to
      Major Hammertons you must let me know; but perhaps you will inquire
      further before you fix. And now, hoping that you will stick to your
      hunting, and be more successful on another horse after a quieter fox,
      believe me ever, my own dearest William, your most truly and sincerely
      affectionate mother,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i> &ldquo;Emma Pringle. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Don&rsquo;t forget the two clean shirts.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;When you give Dicky Boggledike the pin, you can compliment him
      on his talents as a huntsman (as Mr. Redpath did the actor); and as they
      say he is a very bad one, he will be all the more grateful for it.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I have just had another most pressing letter from your uncle
      Jerry, urging me to go and look through all the accounts and papers, as he
      says it is not fair throwing such a heavy responsibility upon him. Poor
      man! He need not be so pressing. He little knows how anxious I am to do
      it. I hope now we shall get something satisfactory, for as yet I know no
      more than I did before your poor father died.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Don&rsquo;t forget to tell me if there are any Miss H.&lsquo;s, and
      whatever you do, take care of Dowb, that is, yourself.&rdquo;</i>
     </p>
    <p>
      But somehow Billy forgot to tell his Mamma whether there were any Miss
      H.&lsquo;s or not, though he might have said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; seeing they were Miss &ldquo;Y.&lsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now, while our hero is recovering from his bruises, let us introduce
      the reader further to his next host, Major Y.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.<br/>MAJOR YAMMERTON&rsquo;S COACH STOPS THE WAY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>AJOR Yammerton was
      rather a peculiar man, inasmuch as he was an Ass, without being a Fool. He
      was an Ass for always puffing and inflating himself, while as regarded
      worldly knowledge, particularly that comprised in the magic letters £. s.
      d., few, if any, were his equals. In the former department, he was always
      either on the strut or the fret, always either proclaiming the marked
      attention he had met with, or worrying himself with the idea that he had
      not had enough. At home, instead of offering people freely and hospitably
      what he had, he was continually boring them with apologies for what he had
      not. Just as if all men were expected to have things alike, or as if the
      Major was an injured innocent who had been defrauded of his rights. If he
      was not boring and apologising, then he was puffing or praising everything
      indiscriminately&mdash;depending, of course, upon who he had there&mdash;a
      great gun or a little one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned from his Tantivy Castle hunt, very much pleased with our
      Billy, who seemed to be just the man for his money, and by the aid of his
      Baronetage he made him out to be very highly connected. Mrs. Yammerton and
      the young ladies were equally delighted with him, and it was unanimously
      resolved that he should be invited to the Grange, for which purpose the
      standing order of the house &ldquo;never to invite any one direct from a great
      house to theirs,&rdquo; was suspended. A very salutary rule it is for all who
      study appearances, seeing that what looks very well one way may look very
      shady the other; but this being perhaps a case of &ldquo;now or never,&rdquo; the
      exception would seem to have been judiciously made. The heads of the house
      had different objects in view; Mamma&rsquo;s, of course, being matrimonial, the
      Major&rsquo;s, the laudable desire to sell Mr. Pringle a horse. And the mention
      of Mamma&rsquo;s object leads us to the young ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, Clara, Flora, and Harriet, were very pretty, and very highly
      educated&mdash;that is to say, they could do everything that is useless&mdash;play,
      draw, sing, dance, make wax-flowers, bead-stands, do decorative gilding,
      and crochet-work; but as to knowing how many ounces there are in a pound
      of tea, or how many pounds of meat a person should eat in a day, they were
      utterly, entirely, and most elegantly ignorant. Towards the close of the
      last century, and at the beginning of the present one, ladies ran entirely
      to domesticity, pickling, preserving, and pressing people to eat. Corded
      petticoats and patent mangles long formed the staple of a mid life woman&rsquo;s
      conversation. Presently a new era sprang up, which banished everything in
      the shape of utilitarianism, and taught the then rising generation that
      the less they knew of domestic matters the finer ladies they would be,
      until we really believe the daughters of the nobility are better
      calculated for wives, simply because they are generally economically
      brought up, and are not afraid of losing <i>caste</i>, by knowing what
      every woman ought to do. No man thinks the worse of a woman for being able
      to manage her house, while few men can afford to marry mere music-stools
      and embroidery frames. Mrs. Yammerton, however, took a different view of
      the matter. She had been brought up in the patent mangle and corded
      petticoat school, and inwardly resolved that her daughters should know
      nothing of the sort&mdash;should be &ldquo;real ladies,&rdquo; in the true kitchen
      acceptation of the term. Hence they were mistresses of all the little
      accomplishments before enumerated, which, with making calls and drinking
      tea, formed the principal occupation of their lives. Not one of them could
      write a letter without a copy, and were all very uncertain in their
      spelling&mdash;though they knew to a day when every King and Queen began
      to reign, and could spout all the chief towns in the kingdom. Now this
      might have been all very well, at least bearable, if the cockey Major had
      had plenty of money to give them, but at the time they were acquiring
      them, the &ldquo;contrary was the case,&rdquo; as the lawyers say. The Major&rsquo;s
      grandfather (his father died when he was young) had gone upon the old
      annexation principle of buying land and buying land simply because &ldquo;it
      joined,&rdquo; and not always having the cash to pay for it with, our Major came
      into an estate (large or small, according as the reader has more or less
      of his own) saddled with a good, stout, firmly setting mortgage. Land,
      however, being the only beast of burthen that does not show what it
      carries, our orphan&mdash;orphan in top-boots to be sure&mdash;passed for
      his best, and was speedily snapped up by the then beautiful, Italian&mdash;like
      Miss Winnington, who consoled herself for the collapse of his fortune, by
      the reflection that she had nothing of her own. Perhaps, too, she had made
      allowance for the exaggeration of estimates, which generally rate a man at
      three or four times his worth. The Winningtons, however, having made a
      great &ldquo;crow&rdquo; at the &ldquo;catch,&rdquo; the newly-married couple started at score as
      if the estate had nothing to carry but themselves.

      In due time the three graces appeared,&mdash;Clara, very fair, with large
      languishing blue eyes and light hair; Flora, with auburn hair and hazel
      eyes; and Harriet, tall, clear, and dark, like Mamma. As they grew up, and
      had had their heads made into Almanacs at home, they were sent to the
      celebrated Miss Featherey&rsquo;s finishing and polishing seminary at Westbourne
      Grove, who for £200 a-year, or as near £200 as she could get, taught them
      all the airs and graces, particularly how to get in and out of a carriage
      properly, how to speak to a doctor, how to a counter-skipper, how to a
      servant, and so on. The Major, we may state, had his three daughters taken
      as two. Well, just as Miss Harriet was supplying the place of Miss Clara
      (polished), that great agricultural revolution, the repeal of the corn
      laws, took place, and our Major, who had regarded his estate more with an
      eye to its hunting and shooting capabilities than to high farming, very
      soon found it slipping away from him, just as Miss de Glancey slipped away
      from her dress in the thunder-storm. Up to that time, his easy-minded
      agent, Mr. Bullrush, a twenty stone man of sixty years of age, had thought
      the perfection of management was not to let an estate go back, but now the
      Major&rsquo;s seemed likely to slip through its girths altogether. To be sure,
      it had not had any great assistance in the advancing line, and was just
      the same sour, rush-grown, poachy, snipe-shooting looking place that it
      was when the Major got it; but this was not his grandfather&rsquo;s fault, who
      had buried as many stones in great gulf-like drains, as would have carried
      off a river and walled the estate all round into the bargain; but there
      was no making head against wet land with stone drains, the bit you cured
      only showing the wetness of the rest. The blotchy March fallows looked as
      if they had got the small pox, the pastures were hardly green before
      Midsummer, and the greyhound-like cattle that wandered over them were
      evidently of Pharaoh&rsquo;s lean sort, and looked as if they would <i>never</i>
      be ready for the butcher. Foreign cattle, too, were coming in free, and
      the old cry of &ldquo;down corn, down horn,&rdquo; frightened the fabulously famed
      &ldquo;stout British farmer&rdquo; out of his wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then those valuable documents called leases&mdash;so binding on the
      landlord, were found to be wholly inoperative on the tenants, who threw up
      their farms as if there were no such things in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Major wouldn&rsquo;t take their givings up, why then he might just do his
      &ldquo;warst;&rdquo; meanwhile, of course, they would &ldquo;do their warst,&rdquo; by the land.
      With those who had nothing (farming and beer-shop keeping being about the
      only trades a man can start with upon nothing), of course, it was of no
      use persisting, but the awkward part of the thing was, that this probing
      of pockets showed that in too many cases the reputed honesty of the
      British farmer was also mere fiction; for some who were thought to be well
      off, now declared that their capital was their aunt&rsquo;s, or their uncle&rsquo;s,
      or their grandmother&rsquo;s, or some one else&rsquo;s, so that the two classes, the
      have-somethings, and the have-nothings, were reduced to a level. This sort
      of thing went on throughout the country, and landlords who could not face
      the difficulty by taking their estates in hand, had to submit to very
      serious reductions of rent, and rent once got down, is very difficult to
      get up again, especially in countries where they value by the rate-book,
      or where a traditionary legend attaches to land of the lowest rent it has
      ever been let for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Major was sorely dispirited, and each market-day, as he returned from
      Mr. Bullrush&rsquo;s with worse and worse news than before, he pondered o&rsquo;er his
      misfortunes, fearing that he would have to give up his hounds and his
      horses, withdraw his daughters from Miss Featherey&rsquo;s, and go to Boulogne,
      and as he contemplated the airy outline of their newly-erected rural
      palace of a workhouse, he said it was lucky they had built it, for he
      thought they would all very soon be in it. Certainly, things got to their
      worst in the farming way, before they began to mend, and such land as the
      Major&rsquo;s&mdash;good, but &ldquo;salivated with wet,&rdquo; as the cabman said of his
      coat&mdash;was scarcely to be let at any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these go-a-head days of farming, when the enterprising sons of trade
      are fast obliterating the traces of the heavy-heel&rsquo;d order of easy-minded
      Hodges who,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;held their farms and lived content
While one year paid another&rsquo;s rent,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      without ever making any attempt at improvement, it may be amusing to
      record the business-like offer of some of those indolent worthies who
      would bid for a pig in a poke. Thus it runs:&mdash;It should have been
      dated April 1, instead of 21:&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      TO MAJOR YAMMERTON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onard Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Hobnail Hill, April 21. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheas We have considered we shall give you for Bonnyrig&rsquo;s farme the som
      £100 25 puns upon condishinds per year if you should think it to little we
      may perhaps advance a little as we have not looked her carefully over her
      and for character Mr. Sowerby will give you every information as we are
      the third giniration that&rsquo;s been under the Sowerbys.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Yours sincerely,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Henerey Brown,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Homfray Brown&mdash;Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>If you want anye otes I could sell you fifteen bowels of verye fine
      ones.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the &ldquo;som £100 25 puns&rdquo; being less than half what the Major&rsquo;s
      grandfather used to get for the farm:&mdash;viz. &ldquo;£200 63 puns,&rdquo;&mdash;our
      Major was considerably perplexed; and as &ldquo;Henerey and Homfray&rdquo;&rsquo;s offer was
      but a sample of the whole, it became a question between Boulogne and
      Bastile, as those once unpopular edifices, the workhouses, were then
      called. And here we may observe, that there is nothing perhaps, either so
      manageable or so unmanageable as land&mdash;nothing easier to keep right
      than land in good order, and nothing more difficult to get by the head,
      and stop, than land that has run wild; and it may be laid down as an
      infallible rule, that the man who has no taste for land or horses should
      have nothing to do with either. He should put his money in the funds, and
      rail or steam when he has occasion to travel. He will be far richer, far
      fatter, and fill the bay window of his club far better, than by undergoing
      the grinding of farmers and the tyranny of grooms. Land, like horses, when
      once in condition is easily kept so, but once let either go down, and the
      owner becomes a prey to the scratchers and the copers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, however, a man likes a little occupation better than the eternal
      gossip, and &ldquo;<i>who&rsquo;s that?</i>&rdquo; of the clubs, and prefers a smiling
      improving landscape to a barren retrograding scene, he will find no
      pleasanter, healthier, or more interesting occupation than improving his
      property. And a happy thing it was for this kingdom, that Prince Albert
      who has done so much to refine and elevate mankind, should have included
      farming in the list of his amusements,&mdash;bringing the before despised
      pursuit into favour and fashion, so that now instead of land remaining a
      prey to the &ldquo;Henerey Browns &amp; Co.&rdquo; of life, we find gentlemen
      advertising for farms in all directions, generally stipulating that they
      are to be on the line of one or other of the once derided railways.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are getting in advance of the times with our Major, whom we left in
      the slough of despond, consequent on the coming down of his rents. Just
      when things were at their worst, the first sensible sunbeam of simplicity
      that ever shone upon land, appeared in the shape of the practical,
      easy-working Drainage Act, an act that has advanced agriculture more than
      all previous inventions and legislation put together. But our gallant
      friend had his difficulties to contend with even here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bullrush was opposed to it. He was fat and didn&rsquo;t like trouble, so he
      doubted the capacity of such a pocket companion as a pipe to carry off the
      superfluous water, then he doubted the ability of the water to get into
      the pipe at such a depth, above all he doubted the ability of the tenants
      to pay drainage interests. &ldquo;How could they if they couldn&rsquo;t pay their
      rents?&rdquo; Of course, the tenants adopted this view of the matter, and were
      all opposed to making what they called &ldquo;experiences,&rdquo; at their own
      expense; so upon the whole, Mr. Bullrush advised the Major to have nothing
      to do with it. It being, however, a case of necessity with the Major, he
      disregarded Mr. Bullrush&rsquo;s advice which led to a separation, and being now
      a free agent, he went boldly at the government loan, and soon scared all
      the snipes and half the tenants off his estate. The water poured off in
      torrents; the plump juicy rushes got the jaundice, and Mossington bog,
      over which the Major used to have to scuttle on foot after his &ldquo;haryers,&rdquo;
       became sound enough to carry a horse. Then as Mr. Bullrush rode by and saw
      each dreary swamp become sound ground, he hugged himself with the sloven&rsquo;s
      consolation that it &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t p-a-a-y.&rdquo; Pay, however, it did, for our
      Major next went and got some stout horses, and the right sort of
      implements of agriculture, and soon proved the truth of the old adage,
      that it is better to follow a sloven than a scientific farmer. He worked
      his land well, cleaned it well, and manured it well; in which three simple
      operations consists the whole science of husbandry, and instead of growing
      turnips for pickling, as his predecessors seemed to do, he got great
      healthy Swedes that loomed as large as his now fashionable daughter&rsquo;s
      dresses. He grew as many &ldquo;bowels&rdquo; of oats upon one acre of land as any
      previous tenant had done upon three. So altogether, our Major throve, and
      instead of going to Boulogne, he presently set up the Cockaded Coach in
      which we saw him arrive at Tantivy Castle. Not that he went to a
      coachmaker&rsquo;s and said, &ldquo;Build me a roomy family coach regardless of
      expense,&rdquo; but, finding that he couldn&rsquo;t get an inside seat along with the
      thirty-six yard dresses in the old chariot, he dropped in at the sale of
      the late Squire Trefoil&rsquo;s effects, who had given some such order, and,
      under pretence of buying a shower-bath, succeeded in getting a capital
      large coach on its first wheels for ten pounds,&mdash;scarcely the value
      of the pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a contrast to Henerey Brown and Co.&lsquo;s business-like offer for the farm,
      and in illustration of the difference between buying and selling, we
      append the verbose estimate of this ponderous affair. Thus it runs&mdash;

      Three hundred and ninety pounds! And to think that the whole should come
      to be sold for ten sovereigns. Oh, what a falling off was there, my
      coachmakers! Surely the King of the Cannibal Islands could never afford to

    <p>
      &ldquo;Five-and-thirty years master of haryers without a subscription!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, we think, is rather an exaggeration, both as regards time and money,
      unless the Major reckons an undivided moiety he had in an old lady-hound
      called &ldquo;Lavender&rdquo; along with the village blacksmith of Billinghurst when
      he was at school. If he so calculates, then he would be right as to time,
      but wrong as to money, for the blacksmith paid his share of the tax, and
      found the greater part of the food. For thirty years, we need hardly tell
      the reader of sporting literature, that the Major had been a master of
      harriers&mdash;for well has he blown the horn of their celebrity during
      the whole of that long period&mdash;never were such harriers for finding
      jack hares, and pushing them through parishes innumerable, making them
      take rivers, and run as straight as railways, putting the costly
      performances of the foxhounds altogether to the blush. Ten miles from
      point to point, and generally without a turn, is the usual style of thing,
      the last run with this distinguished pack being always unsurpassed by any
      previous performance. Season after season has the sporting world been
      startled with these surprising announcements, until red-coated men, tired
      of blanks and ringing foxes, have almost said, &ldquo;Dash my buttons, if I
      won&rsquo;t shut up shop here and go and hunt with these tremendous harriers,&rdquo;
       while other currant-jelly gentlemen, whose hares dance the fandango before
      their plodding pack, have sighed for some of these wonderful &ldquo;Jacks&rdquo; that
      never make a curve, or some of the astonishing hounds that have such a
      knack at making them fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, but the reader will, perhaps, say it&rsquo;s the blood that does it&mdash;the
      Major has an unrivalled, unequalled strain of harrier blood that nobody
      else can procure. Nothing of the sort! Nothing of the sort! The Major&rsquo;s
      blood is just anything he can get. He never misses a chance of selling
      either a single hound or a pack, and has emptied his kennel over and over
      again. But then he always knows where to lay hands on more; and as soon as
      ever the new hounds cross his threshold they become the very &ldquo;best in the
      world&rdquo;&mdash;better than any he ever had before. They then figure upon
      paper, just as if it was a continuous pack; and the field being under
      pretty good command, and, moreover, implicated in the honour of their
      performances, the thing goes on smoothly and well, and few are any the
      wiser. There is nothing so popular as a little fuss and excitement, in
      which every man may take his share, and this it is that makes scratch
      packs so celebrated. Their followers see nothing but their perfections.
      They are
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;To their faults a little blind,
And to their virtues ever kind.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      At the period of which we are writing, the Major&rsquo;s pack was rather better
      than usual, being composed of the pick of three packs,&mdash;&ldquo;cries of
      dogs&rdquo; rather&mdash;viz., the Corkycove harriers, kept by the shoemakers of
      Waxley; the Bog-trotter harriers (four couple), kept by some moor-edge
      miners; the Dribbleford dogs, upon whom nobody would pay the tax; and of
      some two or three couple of incurables, that had been consigned from
      different kennels on condition of the Major returning the hampers in which
      they came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major was open to general consignments in the canine line&mdash;Hounds,
      Pointers, Setters, Terriers, &amp;c.&mdash;not being of George the Third&rsquo;s
      way of thinking, who used to denounce all &ldquo;presents that eat.&rdquo; He would
      take anything; anything, at least, except a Greyhound, an animal that he
      held in mortal abhorrence. What he liked best was to get a Lurcher, for
      which he soon found a place under a pear-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major&rsquo;s huntsman, old Solomon, was coachman, shepherd, groom, and
      gamekeeper, as well as huntsman, and was the cockaded gentleman who drove
      the ark on the occasion of our introduction. In addition to all this, he
      waited at table on grand occasions, and did a little fishing, hay-making,
      and gardening in the summer. He was one of the old-fashioned breed of
      servants, now nearly extinct, who passed their lives in one family and
      turned their hands to whatever was wanted. The Major, whose maxim was not
      to keep any cats that didn&rsquo;t catch mice, knowing full well that all
      gentlemen&rsquo;s servants can do double the work of their places, provided they
      only get paid for it, resolved, that it was cheaper to pay one man the
      wages of one-and-a-half to do the work of two men, than to keep two men to
      do the same quantity; consequently, there was very little hissing at bits
      and curb-chains in the Major&rsquo;s establishment, the hard work of other
      places being the light work, or no work at all, of his. Solomon was the <i>beau
      idéal</i> of a harrier huntsman, being, as the French say, <i>d&rsquo;un certain
      age</i>, quiet, patient, and a pusillanimous rider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now about the subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that the Major did not take a subscription in the common
      acceptation of the term, but he took assistance in various ways, such as a
      few days ploughing from one man, a few &ldquo;bowels&rdquo; of seed-wheat from
      another, a few &ldquo;bowels&rdquo; of seed-oats from a third, a lamb from a fourth, a
      pig from a fifth, added to which, he had all the hounds walked during the
      summer, so that his actual expenses were very little more than the tax.
      This he jockeyed by only returning about two-thirds the number of hounds
      he kept; and as twelve couple were his hunting maximum, his taxing minimum
      would be about eight&mdash;eight couple&mdash;or sixteen hounds, at twelve
      shillings a-piece, is nine pound twelve, for which sum he made more noise
      in the papers than the Quorn, the Belvoir, and the Cottesmore all put
      together. Indeed the old adage of &ldquo;great cry and little wool,&rdquo; applies to
      packs as well as flocks, for we never see hounds making a great &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; in
      the papers without suspecting that they are either good for nothing, or
      that the fortunate owner wants to sell them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to horses, the Major, like many people, had but one sort&mdash;the
      best in England&mdash;though they were divided into two classes, viz.,
      hunters and draught horses. Hacks or carriage horses he utterly eschewed.
      Horses must either hunt or plough with him; nor was he above putting his
      hunters into the harrows occasionally. Hence he always had a pair of
      efficient horses for his carriage when he wanted them, instead of animals
      that were fit to jump out of their skins at starting, and ready to slip
      through them on coming home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clothing he utterly repudiated for carriage horses, alleging, that people
      never get any work out of them after they are once clothed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunters were mostly sedate, elderly animals, horses that had got
      through the &ldquo;morning of life&rdquo; with the foxhounds, and came to the harriers
      in preference to harness. The Major was always a buyer or an exchanger, or
      a mixer of both, and would generally &ldquo;advance a little&rdquo; on the
      neighbouring job-master&rsquo;s prices. Then having got them, he recruited the
      veterans by care and crushed corn, which, with cutting their tails, so
      altered them, that sometimes their late groom scarcely knew them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly, if the animals could have spoken, they would have expressed
      their surprise at the different language the Major held as a buyer and as
      a seller; as a buyer, when like Gil Blas&rsquo; mule, he made them out to be all
      faults, as a seller when they suddenly seemed to become paragons of
      perfection. He was always ready for a deal, and would accommodate matters
      to people&rsquo;s convenience&mdash;take part cash, part corn, part hay, part
      anything, for he was a most miscellaneous barterer, and his stable loft
      was like a Marine Store-dealer&rsquo;s shop. Though always boasting that his
      little white hands were not &ldquo;soiled with trade,&rdquo; he would traffic in
      anything (on the sly) by which he thought he could turn a penny. His last
      effort in the buying way had nearly got him into the County Court, as the
      following correspondence will show, as also how differently two people can
      view the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in town, with wheat at 80s. and barley and oats in proportion, and
      consequently more plethoric in the pocket than usual, he happened to stray
      into a certain great furniture mart where two chairs struck him as being
      cheap. They were standing together, and one of them was thus ticketed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
No. 8205.

2 Elizabethan chairs.

India Japanned.

43 s.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Major took a good stare at them, never having seen any before. Well,
      he thought they could not be dear at that; little more than a guinea each.
      Get them home for fifty shillings, say. There was a deal of gold, and
      lacker, and varnish about them. Coloured bunches of flowers, inlaid with
      mother of pearl, Chinese temples, with &ldquo;insolent pig-tailed barbarians,&rdquo;
       in pink silk jackets, with baggy blue trowsers, and gig whips in their
      hands, looking after the purple ducks on the pea-grcen lake&mdash;all very
      elegant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He&rsquo;d have them, dashed if he wouldn&rsquo;t! Would try and swap them for Mrs.
      Rocket Larkspur&rsquo;s Croydon basket-carriage that the girls wanted. Just the
      things to tickle her fancy. So he went into the office and gave his card
      most consequentially, with a reference to Pannell, the sadler in Spur
      Street, Leicestor-square, desiring that the chairs might be most carefully
      packed and forwarded to him by the goods train with an invoice by post.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the invoice came, behold! the 43s. had changed into 86s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hilloa!&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished Major. This won&rsquo;t do! 86s. is twice
      43s.; and he wrote off to say they had made a mistake. This brought the
      secretary of the concern, Mr. Badbill, on to the scene. He replied beneath
      a copious shower of arms, orders, flourish, and flannel, that the mistake
      was the Major&rsquo;s&mdash;that they, &ldquo;never marked their goods in pairs,&rdquo; to
      which the Major rejoined, that they had in this instance, as the ticket
      which he forwarded to Pannell for Badbill&rsquo;s inspection showed, and that he
      must decline the chairs at double the price they were ticketed for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Badbill, having duly inspected the ticket, retorted that he was surprised
      at the Major&rsquo;s stupidity, that two meant one, in fact, all the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major rejoined, that he didn&rsquo;t know what the Reform Bill might have
      done, but that two didn&rsquo;t mean one when he was at school; and added, that
      as he declined the chairs at 86s. they were at Badhill&rsquo;s service for
      sending for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Badbill wrote in reply&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We really cannot understand how it is possible, for any one to make
      out that a ticket on an article includes the other that may stand next it.
      Certainly the ticket you allude to referred only to the chair on which it
      was placed</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in a subsequent letter he claimed to have the chairs repacked at the
      Major&rsquo;s expense, as it was very unfair saddling them with the loss arising
      entirely from the Major&rsquo;s mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which our gallant friend rejoined, &ldquo;that as he would neither admit that
      the mistake was his, nor submit to the imputation of unfairness, he would
      stick to the chairs at the price they were ticketed at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Badbill then wrote that this declaration surprised them much&mdash;that
      they did not for a moment think he &ldquo;intentionally misunderstood the ticket
      as referring to a pair of chairs, whereas it only gave the price of one
      chair,&rdquo; and again begged to have them back; to which the Major inwardly
      responded, he &ldquo;wished they might get them,&rdquo; and sent them an order for the
      43s.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was returned with expressions of surprise, that after the explanation
      given, the Major should persevere in the same &ldquo;course of error,&rdquo; and hoped
      that he would, without further delay, favour the Co. with the right
      amount, for which Badbill said they &ldquo;anxiously waited,&rdquo; and for which the
      Major inwardly said, they &ldquo;might wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In due time came a lithographed circular, more imposingly flourished and
      flanneled than ever, stating the terms of the firm were &ldquo;cash on
      delivery;&rdquo; and that unless the Major remitted without further delay, he
      would be handed over to their solicitor, &amp;c.; with an intimation at
      the bottom, that that was the &ldquo;third application&rdquo;&mdash;of which our
      gallant friend took no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next came a written,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I am desired by this firm to inform you, that unless we hear from you
      by return of post respecting the payment of our account, we shall place
      the matter in the hands of our solicitors without further notice, and
      regret you should have occasioned us so much trouble through your own
      misunderstanding</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the climax. The Major&rsquo;s solicitor went, ticket in hand, and
      tendered the 43s., when the late bullying Badbill was obliged to write as
      follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>It appears you are quite correct rejecting the ticket, and we are in
      error. Our ticketing clerk had placed the figure in the wrong part of the
      card, the figure &lsquo;two&rsquo; referring to the number of chairs in stock, and not
      as understood to signifying chairs for 43s.;</i>&rdquo; and Badbill humorously
      concluded by expressing a hope that the Major would return the chairs and
      continue his custom&mdash;two very unlikely events, as we dare say the
      reader will think, to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, then, was the knowing gentleman who now sought the company of Fine
      Billy; and considering that he is to be besieged on both sides, we hope to
      be excused for having gone a little into his host and hostess&rsquo; pedigree
      and performances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major wrote Billy a well-considered note, saying, that when he could
      spare a few days from his lordship and the foxhounds, it would afford Mrs.
      Yammerton and himself great pleasure if he would come and pay them a visit
      at Yammerton Grange, and the Major would be happy to mount him, and keep
      his best country for him, and show him all the sport in his power, adding,
      that they had been having some most marvellous runs lately&mdash;better
      than any he ever remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, independently of our friend Billy having pondered a good deal on the
      beauty of the young lady&rsquo;s eyes, he could well spare a few days from the
      foxhounds, for his lordship, being quite de Glancey-cured, and wishing to
      get rid of him, had had him out again, and put him on to a more fractious
      horse than before, who after giving him a most indefinite shaking, had
      finally shot him over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl was delighted, therefore, when he heard of the Major&rsquo;s
      invitation, and after expressing great regret at the idea of losing our
      Billy, begged he would &ldquo;come back whenever it suited him:&rdquo; well knowing
      that if he once got him out of the house, he would be very sly if he got
      in again. And so Billy, who never answered Mamma&rsquo;s repeated inquiries if
      there were any &ldquo;Miss H&rsquo;s&rdquo; engaged himself to Yammerton Grange, whither the
      reader will now perhaps have the kindness to accompany him.

    <p>
      AILWAYS have taken the starch out of country magnificence, as well as out
      of town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time was when a visitor could hardly drive up to a great man&rsquo;s door in the
      country in a po&rsquo;chav&mdash;now it would be considered very magnificent&mdash;a
      bliss, or a one-oss fly being more likely the conveyance. The Richest
      Commoner in England took his departure from Tantivy Castle in a one-horse
      fly, into which he was assisted by an immense retinue of servants. It was
      about time for him to be gone for Mons. Jean Rougier had been what he
      called &ldquo;boxaing&rdquo; with the Earl&rsquo;s big watcher, Stephen Stout, to whom
      having given a most elaborate licking, the rest of the establishment were
      up in arms, and would most likely have found a match for Monsieur among
      them. Jack&mdash;that is to say, Mons. Jean&mdash;now kissed his hand, and
      grinned, and bowed, and <i>bon-jour&rsquo;d</i> them from the box of the fly,
      with all the affability of a gentleman who has had the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off then they ground at as good a trot as the shaky old quadruped could
      raise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is undoubtedly a good sound principle that Major and Mrs. Yammerton
      went upon, never to invite people direct from great houses to theirs; it
      dwarfs little ones so. A few days ventilation at a country inn with its
      stupid dirty waiters, copper-showing plate, and wretched cookery, would be
      a good preparation, only no one ever goes into an inn in England that can
      help it. Still, coming down from a first-class nobleman&rsquo;s castle to a
      third-class gentleman&rsquo;s house, was rather a trial upon the latter. Not
      that we mean to say anything disrespectful of Yammerton Grange, which,
      though built at different times, was good, roomy, and rough-cast, with a
      man-boy in brown and yellow livery, who called himself the &ldquo;Butler,&rdquo; but
      whom the women-servants called the &ldquo;Bumbler.&rdquo; The above outline will give
      the reader a general idea of the &ldquo;style of thing,&rdquo; as the insolvent dandy
      said, when he asked his creditors for a &ldquo;wax candle and eau-de-Cologne&rdquo;
       sort of allowance. Everything at the Grange of course was now put into
      holiday garb, both externally and internally&mdash;gravel raked, garden
      spruced, stables strawed, &amp;c. All the Major&rsquo;s old sheep-caps, old
      hare-snares, old hang-locks, old hedging-gloves, pruning-knives, and
      implements of husbandry were thrust into the back of the drawer of the
      passage table, while a mixed sporting and military trophy, composed of
      whips, swords and pistols, radiated round his Sunday hat against the wall
      above it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drawing-room, we need not say, underwent metamorphose, the chairs and
      sofas suddenly changing from rather dirty print to pea-green damask, the
      druggeted carpet bursting into cornucopias of fruit and gay bouquets,
      while a rich cover of many colours adorned the centre table, which, in
      turn, was covered with the proceeds of the young ladies&rsquo; industry. The
      room became a sort of exhibition of their united accomplishments. The
      silver inkstand surmounted a beautiful unblemished blotting-book, fresh
      pens and paper stood invitingly behind, while the little dictionary was
      consigned, with other &ldquo;sundries,&rdquo; to the well of the ottoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the finishing preparations were progressing, the Major and Mrs.
      Yammerton carried on a broken discussion as to the programme of
      proceedings, and as, in the Major&rsquo;s opinion,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing can compare,
To hunting of the hare,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      he wanted to lead off with a <i>gallope</i>, to which Mrs. Yammerton
      demurred. She thought it would be a much better plan to have a quiet day
      about the place&mdash;let the girls walk Mr. Pringle up to Prospect Hill
      to see the view from Eagleton Rocks, and call on Mrs. Wasperton, and show
      him to her ugly girls, in return for their visit with Mr. Giles Smith. The
      Major, on the contrary, thought if there was to be a quiet day about the
      place, he would like to employ it in showing Billy a horse he had to sell;
      but while they were in the midst of the argument the click of front gate
      sneck, followed by the vehement bow-wow-wow-wow-wow bark of the Skye
      terrier, Fury, announced an arrival, and from behind a ground-feathering
      spruce, emerged the shaky old horse, dragging at its tail the heavily
      laden cab. Then there was such a scattering of crinoline below, and such a
      gathering of cotton above, to see the gentleman alight, and such
      speculations as to his Christian name, and which of the young ladies he
      would do for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say his name&rsquo;s Harry!&rdquo; whispered Sally Scuttle, the housemaid, into
      Benson&rsquo;s&mdash;we beg pardon&mdash;Miss Benson&rsquo;s, the ladies&rsquo;-maid&rsquo;s ear,
      who was standing before her, peeping past the faded curtains of the
      chintz-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s John!&rdquo; replied Miss Benson, now that Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s head
      appeared at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s Joseph!&rdquo; interposed Betty Bone, the cook, who stood behind
      Sally Scuttle, at which speculation they all laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoot, no! he&rsquo;s not a bit like Joseph,&rdquo; replied Sally, eyeing Billy as he
      now alighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lauk! he&rsquo;s quite a young gent,&rdquo; observed Bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Young!</i> to be sure!&rdquo; replied Miss Henson; &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose we want
      any old&rsquo;uns here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do nicely for Miss;&rdquo; observed Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not for Miss F.?&rdquo; asked Henson, from whom she had just received
      an old gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, either,&rdquo; rejoined Sally; &ldquo;only Miss had the last chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, curates go for nothin&rsquo;!&rdquo; retorted Benson; &ldquo;if it had been a captin it
      would have been something like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but there&rsquo;s Miss Harriet; you never mention Miss Harriet, why
      shouldn&rsquo;t Miss Harriet have a chance?&rdquo; interposed the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. Miss Harriet must wait her turn. Let her sisters be served first.
      They can&rsquo;t all have him, you know, so it&rsquo;s no use trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy having entered the house, the ladies&rsquo; attention was now directed to
      Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a thick, plummy man he is!&rdquo; observed Benson, looking down on
      Rougier&rsquo;s broad shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks as if he got his vittles well,&rdquo; rejoined Bone, wondering how he
      would like their lean beef and bacon fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will he have to sleep?&rdquo; asked Sally Scuttle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, with the Bumbler to be sure,&rdquo; replied Bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not <i>he!</i>&rdquo; interposed Miss Benson, with disdain. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose a
      reg&rsquo;lar valley-de-chambre &lsquo;ill condescend to sleep with a footman! You
      don&rsquo;t know them&mdash;if you think that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got mouse catchers,&rdquo; observed Sally Scuttle, who had been eyeing
      Monsieur intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and a beard like a blacking brush,&rdquo; whispered Bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s surely a foreigner,&rdquo; whispered Benson, as Monsieur&rsquo;s, &ldquo;<i>I say!</i>
      take <i>vell</i> care of her!&mdash;<i>lee</i>aft her down j-e-a-ntly&rdquo;
       (alluding to his own carpet bag, in which he had a bottle of rum enveloped
      in swaddling clothes of dirty linen) to the cabman, sounded upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is,&rdquo; replied Benson, adding, after a pause, &ldquo;Well, anybody may have
      him for me;&rdquo;&mdash;saying which she tripped out of the room, quickly
      followed by the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Major having, on the first alarm, rushed off to his dirty Sanctum, and
      crowned himself with a drab felt wide-a-wake, next snatched a little
      knotty dog-whip out of the trophy as he passed, and was at the sash door
      of the front entrance welcoming our hero with the full spring tide of
      hospitality as he alighted from his fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major was overjoyed to see him. It was indeed kind of him, leaving the
      castle to &ldquo;come and visit them in their &lsquo;umble abode.&rdquo; The Major, of
      course, now being on the humility tack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me take your cloak!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;let me take your cap!&rdquo; and, with the
      aid of the Bumbler, who came shuffling himself into his brown and yellow
      livery coat, Billy was eased of his wrapper, and stood before the now
      thrown-open drawing-room door, just as Mrs. Yammerton having swept the
      last brown holland cover off the reclining chair, had stuffed it under the
      sofa cushion. She, too, was delighted to see Billy, and thankful she had
      got the room ready, so as to be able presently to subside upon the sofa,
      &ldquo;Morning Post&rdquo; in hand, just as if she had been interrupted in her
      reading. The young ladies then dropped in one by one; Miss at the passage
      door, Miss Flora at the one connecting the drawing-room with the Sanctum,
      and Miss Harriet again at the passage door, all divested of their aprons,
      and fresh from their respective looking-glasses. The two former, of
      course, met Billy as an old acquaintance, and as they did not mean to
      allow Misa Harriet to participate in the prize, they just let her shuffle
      herself into an introduction as best she could. Billy wasn&rsquo;t quite sure
      whether he had seen her before or he hadn&rsquo;t. At first he thought he had;
      then he thought he hadn&rsquo;t; but whether he had or he hadn&rsquo;t, he knew there
      would be no harm in bowing, so he just promiscuated one to her, which she
      acknowledged with a best Featherey curtsey. A great cry of conversation,
      or rather of random observation, then ensued; in the midst of which the
      Major slipped out, and from his Sanctum he overheard Monsieur getting up
      much the same sort of entertainment in the kitchen. There was such
      laughing and giggling and &ldquo;<i>he-hawing</i>&rdquo; among the maids, that the
      Major feared the dinner would be neglected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major&rsquo;s dining-room, though small, would accommodate a dozen people,
      or incommode eighteen, which latter number is considered the most
      serviceable-sized party in the country where people feed off their
      acquaintance, more upon the debtor and creditor system, than with a view
      to making pleasant parties, or considering who would like to meet. Even
      when they are what they call &ldquo;alone,&rdquo; they can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;alone,&rdquo; but must have
      in as many servants as they can raise, to show how far the assertion is
      from the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the Yammertons sat down but six on the present occasion, and there
      were the two accustomed dumb-waiters in the room, three live ones were
      introduced, viz., Monsieur, the Bumbler, and Solomon, whose duty seemed to
      consist in cooling the victuals, by carrying them about, and in preventing
      people from helping themselves to what was before them, by taking the
      dishes off the steady table, and presenting them again on very unsteady
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one is ever allowed to shoot a dish sitting if a servant can see it.
      How pleasant it would be if we were watched in all the affairs of life as
      we are in eating!
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur, we may observe, had completely superseded the Bumbler, just as a
      colonel supersedes a captain on coming up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oi am Colonel Crushington of the Royal Plungers,&rdquo; proclaims the Colonel,
      stretching himself to his utmost altitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am Captain Succumber, of the Sugar-Candy Hussars,&rdquo; bows the Captain
      with the utmost humility; whereupon the Captain is snuffed out, and the
      Colonel reigns in his stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Monsieur Jean Rougier, valet-de-chambre to me lor Pringle, and I
      sail take in de potage,&mdash;de soup,&rdquo; observed Rougier, coming down
      stairs in his first-class clothes, and pushing the now yellow-legged
      Bumbler aside.

    <p>
      And these hobble-de-hoys never being favourites with the fair, the maids
      saw him reduced without remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the dinner got set upon the table without a fight and though Monsieur
      allowed the Bumbler to announce it in the drawing-room, it was only that
      he might take a suck of the sherry while he was away. But he was standing
      as bolt upright as a serjeant-major on parade when &ldquo;me lor&rdquo; entered the
      dining-room with Mrs. Yammerton on his arm, followed by the Graces, the
      Major having stayed behind to blow out the composites.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were soon settled in their places, grace said, and the assault
      commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major was rather behind Imperial John in magnificence, for John had
      got his plate in his drawing-room, while the Major still adhered to the
      good old-fashioned blue and red, and gold and green crockery ware of his
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not but that both Mamma and the young ladies had often represented to him
      the absolute necessity of having plate, but the Major could never fall in
      with it at his price&mdash;that of German silver, or Britannia metal
      perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dare say Fine Billy would never have noticed the deficiency, if the
      Major had not drawn attention to it by apologising for its absence, and
      fearing he would not be able to eat his dinner without; though we dare
      say, if the truth were known our readers&mdash;our male readers at least&mdash;will
      agree with us, that a good, hot well-washed china dish is a great deal
      better than a dull, lukewarm, hand-rubbed silver one. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;wittles&rdquo;
       people look to, not the ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Major was afraid his wine wouldn&rsquo;t pass muster after the Earl&rsquo;s,
      and certainly his champagne was nothing to boast of, being that ambiguous
      stuff that halts between the price of gooseberry and real; in addition to
      which, the Major had omitted to pay it the compliment of icing it, so that
      it stood forth in all its native imperfection. However, it hissed, and
      fizzed, and popped, and banged, which is always something exciting at all
      events; and as the Major sported needle-case-shaped glasses which he had
      got at a sale (very cheap we hope), there was no fear of people getting
      enough to do them any harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giving champagne is one of those things that has passed into custom almost
      imperceptibly. Twenty, or five-and-twenty years ago, a mid-rank-of-life
      person giving champagne was talked of in a very shake-the-head, solemn, &ldquo;I
      wish-it-may-last,&rdquo; style; now everybody gives it of some sort or other. We
      read in the papers the other day of ninety dozen, for which the holder had
      paid £400, being sold for 13s. 6d. a doz.! What a chance that would have
      been for our Major. We wonder what that had been made of.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a happy discovery that giving champagne at dinner saved other wine
      after, for certainly nothing promotes the conviviality of a meeting so
      much as champagne, and there is nothing so melancholy and funereal as a
      dinner party without it. Indeed, giving champagne may be regarded as a
      downright promoter of temperance, for a person who drinks freely of
      champagne cannot drink freely of any other sort of wine after it: so that
      champagne may be said to have contributed to the abolition of the old
      port-wine toping wherewith our fathers were wont to beguile their long
      evenings. Indeed, light wines and London clubs have about banished
      inebriety from anything like good society. Enlarged newspapers, too, have
      contributed their quota, whereby a man can read what is passing in all
      parts of the world, instead of being told whose cat has kittened in his
      own immediate neighbourhood.&mdash;With which philosophical reflections,
      let us return to our party.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although youth is undoubtedly the age of matured judgment and
      connoisseurship in everything, and Billy was quite as knowing as his
      neighbours, he accepted the Major&rsquo;s encomiums on his wine with all the
      confidence of ignorance, and, what is more to the purpose, he drank it.
      Indeed, there was nothing faulty on the table that the Major didn&rsquo;t
      praise, on the old horse-dealing principle of lauding the bad points, and
      leaving the good ones to speak for themselves. So the dinner progressed
      through a multiplicity of dishes; for, to do the ladies justice, they
      always give good fare:&mdash;it is the men who treat their friends to
      mutton-chops and rice puddings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty Bone, too, was a noble-hearted woman, and would undertake to cook
      for a party of fifty,&mdash;roasts, boils, stews, soups, sweets,
      savouries, sauces, and all! And so what with a pretty girl along side of
      him, and two sitting opposite, Billy did uncommonly well, and felt far
      more at home than he did at Tantivy Castle with the Earl and Mrs. Moffatt,
      and the stiff dependents his lordship brought in to dine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major stopped Billy from calling for Burgundy after his cheese by
      volunteering a glass of home-brewed ale, &ldquo;bo-bo-bottled,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when
      he came of age,&rdquo; though, in fact, it had only arrived from Aloes, the
      chemist&rsquo;s, at Hinton, about an hour before dinner. This being only sipped,
      and smacked, and applauded, grace was said, the cloth removed, the Major
      was presently assuring Billy, in a bumper of moderate juvenile port, how
      delighted he was to see him, how flattered he felt by his condescension in
      coming to visit him at his &lsquo;umble abode, and how he &lsquo;oped to make the
      visit agreeable to him. This piece of flummery being delivered, the
      bottles and dessert circulated, and in due time the ladies retired, the
      Misses to the drawing-room, Madam to the pantry, to see that the Bumbler
      had not pocketed any of the cheese-cakes or tarts, for which, boy-like, he
      had a propensity.
    </p>
    <h3>
      * * * *
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Major, we are ashamed to say, had no mirror in his drawing-room,
      wherein the ladies could now see how they had been looking; so, of course,
      they drew to that next attraction&mdash;the fire, which having duly
      stirred, Miss Yammerton and Flora laid their heads together, with each a
      fair arm resting on the old-fashioned grey-veined marble mantel-piece, and
      commenced a very laughing, whispering conversation. This, of course,
      attracted Miss Harriet, who tried first to edge in between them, and then
      to participate at the sides; but she was repulsed at all points, and at
      length was told by Miss Yammerton to &ldquo;<i>get away!</i>&rdquo; as she had
      &ldquo;nothing to do with what they were talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I have,&rdquo; pouted Miss Harriet, who guessed what the conversation was
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Miss Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s between Flora and me,&rdquo; observed Miss Yammerton dryly, with an air of
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but that&rsquo;s not fair!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Harriet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes it is!&rdquo; replied Miss Yammerton, throwing up her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes it <i>is!</i>&rdquo; asserted Miss Flora, supporting her elder sister&rsquo;s
      assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s <i>not!</i>&rdquo; retorted Miss Harriet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t there at the beginning,&rdquo; observed Miss Yammerton, alluding to
      the expedition to Tantivy Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not my fault,&rdquo; replied Miss Harriet, firmly; &ldquo;Pa would go in the
      coach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, you were <i>not</i> there,&rdquo; replied Miss Yammerton tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but I&rsquo;ll <i>ask mamma</i> if that&rsquo;s fair?&rdquo; rejoined Miss Harriet,
      hurrying out of the room.

      CHAPTER XVIII.<br/>A LEETLE, CONTRETEMPS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Major having
      inducted his guest into one of those expensive articles of dining-room
      furniture, an easy chair&mdash;expensive, inasmuch as they cause a great
      consumption of candles, by sending their occupants to sleep,&mdash;now set
      a little round table between them, to which having transferred the
      biscuits and wine, he drew a duplicate chair to the fire for himself, and,
      sousing down in it, prepared for a <i>tête-à-tête</i> chat with our
      friend. He wanted to know what Lord Ladythorne said of him, to sound
      Billy, in fact, whether there was any chance of his making him a
      magistrate. He also wanted to find out how long Billy was going to stay in
      the country, and see whether there was any chance of selling him a horse;
      so he led up to the points, by calling upon Billy to fill a bumper to the
      &ldquo;Merry haryers,&rdquo; observing casually, as he passed the bottle, that he had
      now kept them &ldquo;five-and-thirty years without a subscription, and was as
      much attached to the sport as ever.&rdquo; This toast was followed by the
      foxhounds and Lord Ladythorne&rsquo;s health, which opened out a fine field for
      general dissertation and sounding, commencing with Mr. Boggledike, who,
      the Major not liking, of course, he condemned; and Mrs. Pringle having
      expressed an adverse opinion of him too, Billy adopted their ideas, and
      agreed that he was slow, and ought to be drafted.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his magisterial inquiry the Major was not so fortunate, his lordship
      being too old a soldier to commit himself before a boy like Billy; and the
      Major, after trying every meuse, and every twist, and every turn, with the
      proverbial patience and pertinacity of a hare-hunter, was at length
      obliged to whip off and get upon his horses. When a man gets upon his
      horses, especially after dinner, and that man such an optimist as the
      Major, there is no help for it but either buying them in a lump or going
      to sleep; and as we shall have to endeavour to induce the reader to
      accompany us through the Major&rsquo;s stable by-and-bye, we will leave Billy to
      do which he pleases, while we proceed to relate what took place in another
      part of the house. For this purpose, it will be necessary to &ldquo;<i>ease</i>
      her&mdash;<i>back</i> her,&rdquo; as the Thames steamboat boys say, our story a
      little to the close of the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Jean Rougier having taken the general bearings of the family as
      he stood behind &ldquo;me lor Pringle&rsquo;s&rdquo; chair, retired from active service on
      the coming in of the cheese, and proceeded to Billy&rsquo;s apartment, there to
      arrange the toilette table, and see that everything was <i>comme il faut</i>.
      Billy&rsquo;s dirty boots, of course, he took downstairs to the Bumbler to
      clean, who, in turn, put them off upon Solomon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very smart everything in the room was. The contents of the gorgeous
      dressing-case were duly displayed on the fine white damask cloth that
      covered the rose-colour-lined muslin of the gracefully-fringed and
      festooned toilette cover, whose flowing drapery presented at once an
      effectual barrier to the legs, and formed an excellent repository for old
      crusts, envelopes, curlpapers, and general sweepings. Solid ivory
      hair-brushes, with tortoiseshell combs, cosmetics, curling fluids, oils
      and essences without end, mingled with the bijouterie and knick-nacks of
      the distinguished visitor. Having examined himself attentively in the
      glass, and spruced up his bristles with Billy&rsquo;s brushes, Jack then stirred
      the fire, extinguished the toilette-table candle, which he had lit on
      coming in, and produced a great blue blouse from the bottom drawer of the
      wardrobe, in which, having enveloped himself in order to prevent his fine
      clothes catching dust, he next crawled backwards under the bed. He had not
      lain there very long ere the opening and shutting of downstairs doors,
      with the ringing of a bell, was followed by the rustling of silks, and the
      light tread of airy steps hurrying along the passage, and stopping at the
      partially-opened door. Presently increased light in the apartment was
      succeeded by less rustle and tip-toe treads passing the bed, and making up
      to the looking-glass. The self-inspection being over, candles were then
      flashed about the room in various directions; and Jack having now thrown
      all his energies into his ears, overheard the following hurried <i>sotto
      voce</i> exclamations:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      First Voice. &ldquo;Lauk! what a little dandy it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Second Voice. &ldquo;Look, I say! look at his boots&mdash;one, two, three, four,
      five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten: ten pair, as I live, besides jacks and
      tops.&rdquo;

    <h4>
      <a href="images/145.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      First Voice. &ldquo;And shoes in proportion,&rdquo; the speaker running her candle
      along the line of various patterned shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Voice. (Advancing to the toilette-table). &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look at his studs.
      Wot an assortment! Wonder if those are diamonds or paste he has on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First Voice. &ldquo;Oh, <i>diamonds</i> to be sure&rdquo; (with an emphasis on
      diamonds). &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose such a little swell as that would wear paste.
      See! there&rsquo;s a pearl and diamond ring. Just fits me, I do declare,&rdquo; added
      she, trying it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second Voice. &ldquo;What beautiful carbuncle pins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First Voice. &ldquo;Oh. what studs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Second Voice. &ldquo;Oh. what chains!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      First Voice. &ldquo;Oh, what pins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Second Voice. &ldquo;Oh, what a love of a ring!&rdquo; And so the ladies continued,
      turning the articles hastily over. &ldquo;Oh, how happy he <i>must</i> be,&rdquo;
       sighed a languishing voice, as the inspection proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See! here&rsquo;s his little silver shaving box,&rdquo; observed the first speaker,
      opening it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what <i>he</i> wants with a shaving box,&mdash;got no more beard
      than I have,&rdquo; replied the other, taking up Billy&rsquo;s badger-hair
      shaving-brush, and applying it to her own pretty chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! smell what delicious perfume!&rdquo; now exclaimed the discoverer of the
      shaving-box. &ldquo;Essence of Rondeletia, I do believe! No, extrait de
      millefleurs,&rdquo; added she, scenting her &lsquo;kerchief with some.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a hurried, frightened &ldquo;<i>hush!</i>&rdquo; followed by a &ldquo;Take
      care that ugly man of his doesn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever <i>see</i> such a monster!&rdquo; ejaculated the other earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kept his horrid eyes fixed upon me the whole dinner,&rdquo; observed the first
      speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frights they are,&rdquo; rejoined the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must keep him for a foil,&rdquo; suggested the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, or we&rsquo;ll be caught!&rdquo; replied the alarmist; and forthwith the
      rustling of silks was resumed, the candles hurried past, and the ladies
      tripped softly out of the room, leaving the door ajar, with Jack under the
      bed to digest their compliments at his leisure.
    </p>
    <h3>
      * * * *
    </h3>
    <p>
      But Monsieur was too many for them. Miss had dropped her glove at the foot
      of the bed, which Jack found on emerging from his hiding place, and
      waiting until he had the whole party reassembled at tea, he walked
      majestically into the middle of the drawing-room with it extended on a
      plated tray, his &ldquo;horrid eyes&rdquo; combining all the venom of a Frenchman with
      the <i>hauteur</i> of an Englishman, and inquired, in a loud and audible
      voice, &ldquo;Please, has any lady or shentleman lost its glo-o-ve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have!&rdquo; replied Miss, hastily, who had been wondering where she had
      dropped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, marm,&rdquo; replied Monsieur, bowing and presenting it to her on the
      tray, adding, in a still louder voice, &ldquo;I found it in Monsieur Pringle&rsquo;s
      bed-room.&rdquo; And Jack&rsquo;s flashing eye saw by the brightly colouring girls
      which were the offenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very much shocked was Mamma at the announcement; and the young ladies were
      so put about, that they could scarcely compose themselves at the piano,
      while Miss Harriet&rsquo;s voice soared exultingly as she accompanied herself on
      her harp.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.<br/>THE MAJOR&rsquo;S STUD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>RS. Yammerton
      carried the day, and the young ladies carried paper-booted Billy, or
      rather walked him up to Mrs. Wasperton&rsquo;s at Prospect Hill, and showed him
      the ugly girls, and also the beautiful view from Eagleton Rocks, over the
      wide-spreading vale of Vernerley beyond, which, of course, Billy enjoyed
      amazingly, as all young gentlemen do enjoy views under such pleasant
      circumstances. Perhaps he might have enjoyed it more, if two out of three
      of the dear charmers had been absent, but then things had not got to that
      pass, and Mamma would not have thought it proper&mdash;at least, not
      unless she saw her way to a very decided preference&mdash;which, of
      course, was then out of the question. Billy was a great swell, and the
      &ldquo;chaws&rdquo; who met him stared with astonishment at such an elegant parasol&rsquo;d
      exquisite, picking his way daintily along the dirty, sloppy, rutty lanes.
      Like all gentlemen in similar circumstances, he declared his boots
      &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t take in wet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course, Mamma charged the girls not to be out late, an injunction that
      applied as well to precaution against the night air, as to the importance
      of getting Billy back by afternoon stable time, when the Major purposed
      treating him to a sight of his stud, and trying to lay the foundation of a
      sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps our sporting readers would like to take a look into the Major&rsquo;s
      stable before he comes with his victim, Fine Billy. If so, let them
      accompany us; meanwhile our lady friends can skip the chapter if they do
      not like to read about horses&mdash;or here; if they will step this way,
      and here comes the Dairymaid, they can look at the cows: real Durham
      short-horns, with great milking powers and most undeniable pedigrees. Ah,
      we thought they would tickle your fancy. The cow is to the lady, what the
      horse is to the gentleman, or, on the score of usefulness, what
      hare-hunting is to fox-hunting&mdash;or shooting to hunting. Master may
      have many horses pulled backwards out of his stable without exciting half
      the commiseration among the fair, that the loss of one nice quiet
      milk-giving cushy cow affords. Cows are friendly creatures. They remember
      people longer than almost any other animal, dogs not excepted. Well, here
      are four of them, Old Lily, Strawberry Cream, Red Rose, and Toy; the house
      is clean and sweet, and smells of milk, and well-made hay, instead of the
      nasty brown-coloured snuff-smelling stuff that some people think good
      enough for the poor cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major is proud of his cows, and against the whitewashed wall he has
      pasted the description of a perfect one, in order that people may compare
      the originals with the portrait. Thus it runs:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
She&rsquo;s long in the face, she&rsquo;s fine in the horn,
She&rsquo;ll quickly get fat without cake or corn;
She&rsquo;s clean in her jaws, and full in her chine,
She&rsquo;s heavy in flank, and wide in her loin;
She&rsquo;s broad in her ribs, and long in her rump,
A straight and flat back without ever a hump;
She&rsquo;s wide in her hips, and calm in her eyes,
She&rsquo;s fine in her shoulders, and thin in her thighs;
She&rsquo;s light in her neck, and small in her tail,
She&rsquo;s wide at the breast, and good at the pail.
She&rsquo;s fine in her bone and silky of skin.
She&rsquo;s a grazier&rsquo;s without, and a butcher&rsquo;s within.

      Now for the stable; this way, through the saddle-room, and mind the
      whitening on the walls. Stoop yonr head, for the Major being low himself,
      has made the door on the principle of all other people being low too.
      There, there you are, you see, in a stable as neat and clean as a London
      dealer&rsquo;s; a Newmarket straw plait, a sanded floor with a roomy bench
      against the wall on which the Major kicks his legs and stutters forth the
      merits of his steeds. They are six in number, and before he comes we will
      just run the reader through the lot, with the aid of truth for an
      accompaniment.

      This grey, or rather white one next the wall, White Surrey, as he calls
      him, is the old quivering tailed horse he rode on the de Glancey day, and
      pulled up to save, from the price-depressing inconvenience of being beat.
      He is eighteen years old, the Major having got him when he was sixteen, in
      a sort of part purchase, part swap, part barter deal. He gave young Mr.
      Meggison of Spoonbill Park thirteen pounds ten shillings, an old mahogany
      Piano-Forte, by Broadwood, six and a half octaves, a Squirrel Cage, two
      Sun-blinds, and a very feeble old horse called Nonpareil, that Tom Rivett
      the blacksmith declared it would be like robbing Meggison to put new shoes
      on to, for him. He is a game good shaped old horse, but having frequently
      in the course of a chequered career, been in that hardest of all hard
      places, the hands of young single horse owners, White Surrey has done the
      work of three or four horses. He has been fired and blistered, and
      blistered and fired, till his legs are as round and as callous as those of
      a mahogany dining-table; still it is wonderful how they support him, and
      as he has never given the Major a fall, he rides him as if he thought he
      never would. His price is sometimes fifty, sometimes forty, sometimes
      thirty, and there are times when he might be bought for a little less&mdash;two
      sovereigns, perhaps, returned out of the thirty. The next one to him&mdash;the
      white legged brown,&mdash;is of the antediluvian order too. He is now
      called Woodpecker, but he may be traced by half-a-dozen aliases through
      other stables&mdash;Buckhunter, Captain Tart, Fleacatcher, Sportsman, Marc
      Anthony, &amp;c. He is nearly, if not quite thorough bred, and the ignoble
      purposes to which he has been subjected, false start making, steeple
      chasing, flat and hurdle racing, accounts for the number of his names. The
      Major got him from Captain Caret, of the Apple-pie huzzars, when that
      gallant regiment was ordered out to India,&mdash;taking him all away
      together, saddle, bridle, clothing, &amp;c., for twenty-three pounds, a
      strong iron-bound chest, fit for sea purposes, as the Major described it,
      and a spying glass. This horse, like all the rest of them, indeed, is
      variously priced, depending upon the party asking, sometimes fifty,
      sometimes five-and-twenty would buy him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third is a mare, a black mare, called Star, late the property of Mr.
      Hazey, the horse-dealing master of the Squeezington hounds. Hazey sold her
      in his usual course of horse-dealing cheating to young Mr. Sprigginson, of
      Marygold Lodge, for a hundred and twenty guineas (the shillings back),
      Hazey&rsquo;s discrimination enabling him to see that she was turning weaver,
      and Sprigginson not liking her, returned her on the warranty; when, of
      course, Hazey refusing to receive her, she was sent to the Eclipse Livery
      and Bait Stables at Hinton, where, after weaving her head off, she was
      sold at the hammer to the Major for twenty-nine pounds. Sprig then brought
      an action against Hazey for the balance, bringing half-a-dozen witnesses
      to prove that she wove when she came; Hazey, of course, bringing a dozen
      to swear that she never did nothin&rsquo; &lsquo;o the sort with him, and must have
      learnt it on the road; and the jury being perplexed, and one of them
      having a cow to calve, another wanting to see his sweetheart, and the rest
      wanting their dinners, they just tossed up for it, &ldquo;Heads!&rdquo; for Sprig;
      &ldquo;Tails!&rdquo; for Hazey, and Sprig won. There she goes, you see, weaving
      backwards and forwards like a caged panther in a den. Still she is far
      from being the worst that the Major has; indeed, we are not sure that she
      is not about the best, only, as Solomon says, with reference to her
      weaving, she gets the &ldquo;langer the warser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Number four is a handsome whole coloured bright bay horse, &ldquo;Napoleon the
      Great,&rdquo; as the Major calls him, in hopes that his illustrious name will
      sell him, for of all bad tickets he ever had, the Major thinks Nap is the
      worst. At starting, he is all fire, frisk, and emulation, but before he
      has gone five miles, he begins to droop, and in hunting knocks up entirely
      before he has crossed half-a-dozen fields. He is a weak, watery, washy
      creature, wanting no end of coddling, boiled corn, and linseed tea. One
      hears of two days a-week horses, but Napoleon the Great is a day in two
      weeks one. The reader will wonder how the Major came to get such an
      animal, still more how he came to keep him; above all, how he ever came to
      have him twice. The mystery, however, is explained on the old bartering,
      huckstering, half-and-half system. The Major got him first from Tom
      Brandysneak, a low public-house-keeping leather-plater, one of those
      sporting men, not sportsmen, who talk about supporting the turf, as if
      they did it like the noblemen of old, upon principle, instead of for what
      they can put into their own pockets; and the Major gave Sneak an old green
      dog-cart, a melon frame, sixteen volumes of the &ldquo;Racing Calendar,&rdquo; bound
      in calf, a ton of seed-hay, fifty yards of Croggon&rsquo;s asphalt roofing felt,
      and three &ldquo;golden sovereigns&rdquo; for him. Nap was then doing duty under the
      title of Johnny Raw, his calling being to appear at different posts
      whenever the cruel conditions of a race required a certain number of
      horses to start in order to secure the added money; but Johnny enacted
      that office so often for the benefit of the &ldquo;Honourable Society of
      Confederated Legs,&rdquo; that the stewards of races framed their conditions for
      excluding him; and Johnny&rsquo;s occupation being gone, he came to the Major in
      manner aforesaid. Being, however, a horse of prepossessing appearance, a
      good bay, with four clean black legs, a neat well set-on head, with an
      equally neat set-on tail, a flowing mane, and other &amp;c&rsquo;s, he soon
      passed into the possession of young Mr. Tabberton, of Green Linnet Hill,
      whose grandmamma had just given him a hundred guineas wherewith to buy a
      good horse&mdash;a <i>real</i> good one he was to be&mdash;a
      hundred-guinea-one in fact. Tabberton soon took all the gay insolence out
      of Johnny&rsquo;s tail, and brought him back to the Major, sadly dilapidated&mdash;a
      sad satire upon his former self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Major had filled up his stall with a handsome rich-coloured
      brown mare, with a decidedly doubtful fore-leg; and the Major, all candour
      and affability, readily agreed to exchange, on condition of getting
      five-and-twenty pounds to boot. The mare presently went down to exercise,
      confirming the Major&rsquo;s opinion of the instability of her leg, and
      increasing his confidence in his own judgment. Napoleon the Great, late
      Johnny Raw, now reigns in her stead, and very well he looks in the straw.
      Indeed, that is his proper place; and as many people only keep their
      horses to look at, there is no reason why Napoleon the Great should remain
      in the Major&rsquo;s stables. He certainly won&rsquo;t if the Major can help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number five is a vulgar looking little dun-duck-et-y mud-coloured horse,
      with long white stockings, and a large white face, called Bull-dog, that
      Solomon generally rides. Nobody knows how old he is, or how many masters
      he has had, or where he came from, or who his father was, or whether he
      had a grandfather, or anything whatever about him. The Major got him for a
      mere nothing&mdash;nine pounds&mdash;at Joe Seton&rsquo;s, the runaway Vet&rsquo;s
      sale, about five years ago, and being so desperately ugly and common
      looking, no one has ever attempted to deprive the Major of him either in
      the way of barter or sale. Still Bully is a capital slave, always ready
      either to hunt, or hack, or go in harness, and will pass anything except a
      public-house, being familiarly and favourably known at the doors of every
      one in the county. Like most horses, he has his little peculiarity; and
      his consists of a sort of rheumatic affection of the hind leg, which
      causes him to catch it up, and sends him limping along on three legs, like
      a lame dog, but still he never comes down, and the attack soon goes off.
      Solomon and he look very like their work together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next horse to Bull-dog, and the last in the stable, is Golden-drop, a
      soft, mealy chestnut&mdash;of all colours the most objectionable. He is a
      hot, pulling, hauling, rushing, rough-actioned animal, that gives a rider
      two days&rsquo; exercise in one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of him is, he has the impudence to decline harness; for though
      he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;mill,&rdquo; as they call it, he yet runs backwards as fast as
      forwards, and would crash through a plate-glass window, a gate, a
      conservatory, or anything else that happened to be behind. As a hack he is
      below mediocrity, for in his walk he digs his toes into the ground about
      every tenth step, and either comes down on his nose, or sets off at score
      for fear of a licking, added to which, he shies at every heap of stones
      and other available object on the road, whereby he makes a ten miles&rsquo; 
      journey into one of twelve. The Major got him of Mr. Brisket, the butcher,
      at Hinton, being taken with the way in which his hatless lad spun him
      about the ill-paved streets, with the meat-basket on his arm&mdash;the
      full trot, it may be observed, being the animal&rsquo;s pace&mdash;but having
      got him home, the more the Major saw of him the less he liked him. He had
      a severe deal for him too, and made two or three journeys over to Hinton
      on market-days, and bought a pennyworth of whipcord of one saddler, a set
      of spur-leathers of another, a pot of harness-paste of a third, in order
      to pump them about the horse ere he ventured to touch. He also got Mr.
      Paul Straddler, the disengaged gentleman of the place, whose greatest
      pleasure is to be employed upon a deal, to ferret out all he could about
      him, who reported that the horse was perfectly sound, and a capital
      feeder, which indeed he is, for he will attack anything, from a hayband
      down to a hedge-stake. You see he&rsquo;s busy on his bedding now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brisket knowing his man, and that the Major killed his own mutton, and
      occasionally beef, in the winter, so that there was no good to be got of
      him in the meat way, determined to ask a stiff price, viz., £25 (Brisket
      having given £14, which the Major having beat down to £23 commenced on the
      mercantile line, which Brisket&rsquo;s then approaching marriage favoured, and
      the Major ultimately gave a four-post mahogany bedstead, with blue damask
      furniture, palliasse and mattress to match; a mahogany toilet-mirror, 23
      inches by 28: a hot-water pudding-dish, a silver-edged cake-basket, a bad
      barometer, a child&rsquo;s birch-wood crib, a chess-board, and £2 10 s. in cash
      for him, the £2 10 s.. being, as the Major now declares (to himself, of
      course,) far more than his real worth. However, there the horse stands;
      and though he has been down twice with the Major, and once with the
      Humbler, these little fore paws (<i>faux pas</i>) as the Major calls them,
      have been on the soft, and the knees bear no evidence of the fact. Such is
      our friend&rsquo;s present stud, and such is its general character.
    </p>
    <p>
      But stay! We are omitting the horse in this large family-pew-looking box
      at the end, whose drawn curtains have caused us to overlook him. He is
      another of the Major&rsquo;s bad tickets, and one of which he has just become
      possessed in the following way:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Having&mdash;in furtherance of his character of a &ldquo;thorrer sportsman,&rdquo; and
      to preserve the spirit of impartiality so becoming an old master of
      &ldquo;haryers&rdquo;&mdash;gone to Sir Moses Mainchance&rsquo;s opening day, as well as to
      my Lord&rsquo;s, Sir Moses, as if in appreciation of the compliment, had offered
      to give the horse on which his second whip was blundering among the blind
      ditches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major jumped at the offer, for the horse looked well with the whip on
      him; and, as he accepted, Sir Moses increased the stream of his generosity
      by engaging the Major to dine and take him away. Sir Moses had a
      distinguished party to meet him, and was hospitality itself. He plied our
      Major with champagne, and hock, and Barsac, and Sauterne, and port, and
      claret, and compliments, but never alluded to the horse until about an
      hour after dinner, when Mr. Smoothley, the jackal of the hunt, brought him
      on the <i>tapis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, as if in sudden recollection, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s true!
      Major, you&rsquo;re quite welcome to &lsquo;Little-bo-peep,&rsquo; (for so he had christened
      him, in order to account for his inquisitive manner of peering). Your <i>quite</i>
      welcome to &lsquo;Little-bo-peep,&rsquo; and I hope he&rsquo;ll be useful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank&rsquo;e, Sir Moses, thank&rsquo;e!&rdquo; bobbed the grateful Major, thinking what a
      good chap the baronet was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Not a bit!</i>&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, chucking up his chin, just as if he
      was in the habit of giving a horse away every other day in the week. &ldquo;<i>Not
      a bit!</i> Keep him as long as you like&mdash;all the season if you please&mdash;and
      send him back when you are done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if in deprecation of any more thanks, he plied the wine again,
      and gave the Major and his &ldquo;harriers&rdquo; in a speech of great gammonosity.
      The Major was divided between mortification at the reduction of the gift
      into a loan, and gratification at the compliment now paid him, but was
      speedily comforted by the flattering reception his health, and the
      stereotyped speech in which he returned thanks, met at the hands of the
      company. He thought he must be very popular. Then, when they were all well
      wined, and had gathered round the sparkling fire with their coffee or
      their Curaçoa in their hands, Sir Moses button-holed the Major with a loud
      familiar, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye what, Yammerton! you&rsquo;re a devilish good feller,
      and there shall be no obligation between us&mdash;you shall just give me
      forty puns for &lsquo;Little-bo-peep,&rsquo; and that&rsquo;s making you a present of him
      for it&rsquo;s a hundred less than I gave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Smoothley, as if delighted
      at Sir Moses having dropped upon the right course. &ldquo;Ah! <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the
      way to do it!&rdquo; repented he, swinging himself gaily round on his toe, with a
      loud snap of his finger and thumb in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sir Moses said it in such a kind, considerate, matter-of-course sort
      of way, before company too, and Smoothley clenched it so neatly, that our
      wine-flushed Major, acute as he is, hadn&rsquo;t presence of mind to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
       So he was saddled with &ldquo;Little-bo-peep,&rdquo; who has already lost one eye from
      cataract, which is fast going with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But see! Here comes Solomon followed by the Bumbler in fustian, and the
      boy from the farm, and we shall soon have the Major and Billy, so let us
      step into Bo-peep&rsquo;s box, and I hear the Major&rsquo;s description of his stud.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scarcely have the grooms dispersed the fast-gathering gloom of a November
      afternoon, by lighting the mould candles in the cord-suspended lanterns
      slung along the ceiling, and began to hiss at the straw, when the Major
      entered, with our friend Billy at his heels. The Bumbler and Chaw then put
      on extra activity, and the stable being presently righted, heads were
      loosened, water supplied, and the horses excited by Solomon&rsquo;s well-known
      peregrination to the crushed corn-bin. All ears were then pricked, eyes
      cast back, and hind-quarters tucked under to respond gaily to the &ldquo;come
      over&rdquo; of the feeder.

    <p>
      The late watchful whinnying restlessness is succeeded by gulping, diving,
      energetic eating. Our friend having passed his regiment of horses in
      silent review, while the hissing was going on, now exchanges a few
      confidential words with the stud groom, as if he left everything to him,
      and then passes upwards to where he started from. Solomon having plenty to
      do elsewhere, presently retires, followed by his helpers, and the Major
      and Billy seat themselves on the bench. After a few puffs and blows of the
      cheeks and premonitory jerks of the legs, the Major nods an approving
      &ldquo;nice &lsquo;oss, that,&rdquo; to Napoleon the Great, standing opposite, who is the
      first to look up from his food, being with it as with his work, always in
      a desperate hurry to begin, and in an equally great one to leave off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice &lsquo;oss, that,&rdquo; repeats the Major, nodding again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse, he looks like a nice &lsquo;orse;&rdquo; replied Billy, which is really as
      much as any man can say under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &lsquo;oss should have won the D-d-d-derby in Nobbler&rsquo;s year,&rdquo; observed
      the Major; &ldquo;only they d-d-drugged him the night before starting, and he
      didn&rsquo;t get half round the c-c-co-course,&rdquo; which was true enough, only it
      wasn&rsquo;t owing to any drugging, for he wasn&rsquo;t worth the expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &lsquo;oss should be in Le-le-le-leieestershire,&rdquo; observed the Major. &ldquo;He
      has all the commandin&rsquo; s-s-s-statur requisite to make large fences look
      s-s-s-small, and the s-s-s-smoothest, oiliest action i-ma-ma-maginable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse;&rdquo; replied Billy, wondering what pleasure there was in looking at a
      lot of blankets and hoods upon horses&mdash;which was about all he could
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He should be at Me-me-melton,&rdquo; observed the Major; still harping on
      Napoleon&mdash;&ldquo;wasted upon haryers,&rdquo; added he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, not caring where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major then took a nod at the Weaver, who, as if in aid of her master&rsquo;s
      design, now stood bolt upright, listening, as it were, instead of reeling
      from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sw-sw-swe-e-t mare,&rdquo; observed the Major, wishing he was rid of
      her. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I would rather have her or the horse (Nap);&rdquo;
       which was true enough, though he knew which he would like to sell Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember the g-g-gray, the whi-white,&rdquo; continued he; looking on at
      the old stager against the wall. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the &lsquo;oss I rode with the Peer, on
      the Castle day, and an undeniable g-g-good one he is;&rdquo; but knowing that he
      was not a young man&rsquo;s horse&mdash;moreover, not wanting to sell him, he
      returned to Napoleon, whose praises he again sounded considerably. Billy,
      however, having heard enough about him, and wanting to get into the house
      to the ladies, drew his attention to Bull-dog, now almost enveloped in
      blankets and straw; but the Major, not feeling inclined to waste any words
      on him either, replied, &ldquo;That he was only a servant&rsquo;s &lsquo;oss.&rdquo; He, however,
      spoke handsomely of Golden-drop, declaring he was the fastest trotter in
      England, perhaps in Europe, perhaps in the world, and would be invaluable
      to a D-d-doctor, or any man who wanted to get over the ground. And then,
      thinking he had said about enough for a beginning, it all at once occurred
      to him that Billy&rsquo;s feet must be wet, and though our friend asserted most
      confidently that they were not, as all townsmen do assert who walk about
      the country in thin soles, the Major persisted in urging him to go in and
      change, which Billy at length reluctantly assented to do.

      not admitting of two such great events as a hunt and a dinner party taking
      place on the same day, and market interfering as well, the hunt again had
      to be postponed to the interests of the table. Such an event as a
      distinguished stranger&mdash;the friend of an Earl, too&mdash;coming into
      the country could not but excite convivial expectations, and it would ill
      become a master of hounds and a mother of daughters not to parade the
      acquisition. Still, raising a party under such circumstances, required a
      good deal of tact and consideration, care, of course, being taken not to
      introduce any matrimonial competitor, at the same time to make the
      gathering sufficiently grand, and to include a good bellman or two to
      proclaim its splendour over the country. The Major, like a county member
      with his constituents, was somewhat hampered with his hounds, not being
      able to ask exactly who he liked, for fear of being hauled over the coals,
      viz. warned off the land of those who might think they ought to have been
      included, and altogether, the party required a good deal of management.
      Inclination in these matters is not of so much moment, it being no
      uncommon thing in the country for people to abuse each other right well
      one day, and dine together the next. The &ldquo;gap&rdquo; which the Major prized so
      much with his hounds, he strongly objected to with his parties.

      Stopping gaps, indeed, sending out invitations at all in the country, so
      as not to look like stopping gaps, requires circumspection, where people
      seem to have nothing whatever to do but to note their neighbours&rsquo; 
      movements. Let any one watch the progress of an important trial, one for
      murder say, and mark the wonderful way in which country people come
      forward, long after the event, to depose to facts, that one would imagine
      would never have been noticed&mdash;the passing of a man with a cow, for
      instance, just as they dropped their noses upon their bacon plates, the
      suspension of payment by their clock, on that morning, or the post
      messenger being a few minutes late with the letters on that day, and so
      on. What then is there to prevent people from laying that and that
      together, where John met James, or Michael saw Mary, so as to be able to
      calculate, whether they were included in the first, second, or third batch
      of invitations? Towns-people escape this difficulty, as also the equally
      disagreeable one of having it known whether their &ldquo;previous engagements&rdquo;
       are real or imaginary; but then, on the other hand, they have the
      inconvenience of feeling certain, that as sure as ever they issue cards
      for a certain day, every one else will be seized with a mania for giving
      dinners on the same one. No one can have an idea of the extent of London
      hospitality&mdash;who has not attempted to give a dinner there. Still, it
      is a difficult world to please, even in the matter of mastication, for
      some people who abuse you if you don&rsquo;t ask them to dine, abuse you quite
      as much if you do. Take the Reverend Mr. Tightlace, the rector, and his
      excellent lady, for instance. Tightlace was always complaining, at least
      observing, that the Yammertons never asked them to dine&mdash;wondered &ldquo;<i>why</i>
      the Yammertons never asked them to dine, was very odd they never asked
      them to dine,&rdquo; and yet, when Miss Yammerton&rsquo;s best copper-plate
      handwriting appeared on the highly-musked best cream-laid satin
      note-paper, &ldquo;requesting, &amp;c.&rdquo; Tightlace pretended to be quite put out
      at the idea of having to go to meet that wild sporting youth, who, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d
      be bound to say, could talk of nothing but hunting.&rdquo; Indeed, having most
      reluctantly accepted the invitation, he found it necessary to cram for the
      occasion, and having borrowed a copy of that veteran volume, the &ldquo;British
      Sportsman,&rdquo; he read up all the long chapter on racing and hunting, how to
      prepare a horse for a hunting match or plate; directions for riding a
      hunting match or plate; of hunting the hare, and hunting the fox, with
      directions for the choice of a hunter, and the management of a hunter;
      part of which latter consisted in putting him to grass between May and
      Bartholomew-tide, and comforting his stomach before going out to hunt with
      toasted bread and wine, or toasted bread and ale, and other valuable
      information of that sort&mdash;all of which Tightlace stored in his mind
      for future use&mdash;thinking to reduce his great intellect to the level
      of Billy&rsquo;s capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Rocket Larkspur, of Ninian Green, were also successfully
      angled for and caught; indeed, Mrs. Larkspur would have been much
      disappointed if they had not been invited, for she had heard of Billy&rsquo;s
      elegant appearance from her maid, and being an aspiring lady, had a great
      desire to cultivate an acquaintance with high life, in which Billy
      evidently moved. Rocket was a good slow sort of gentleman-farmer, quite a
      contrast to his fast wife, who was all fire, bustle, and animation,
      wanting to manage everybody&rsquo;s house and affairs for them. He had married
      her, it was supposed, out of sheer submission, because she had made a dead
      set at him, and would not apparently be said &ldquo;nay&rdquo; to. It is a difficult
      thing to manouvre a determined woman in the country, where your habits are
      known, and they can assail you at all points&mdash;church, streets,
      fields, roads, lanes, all are open to them; or they can even get into your
      house under plea of a charity subscription, if needs be. Mrs. and Miss
      Dotherington, of Goney Garth, were invited to do the Morning Post
      department, and because there was no fear of Miss Dotherington, who was
      &ldquo;very amiable,&rdquo; interfering with our Billy. Mrs. Dotherington&rsquo;s other <i>forte</i>,
      besides propagating parties, consisted in angling for legacies, and she
      was continually on the trot looking after or killing people from whom she
      had, or fancied she had, expectations. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been to see poor Mrs.
      Snuff,&rdquo; she would say, drawing a long face; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s looking <i>wretchedly</i>
      ill, poor thing; fear she&rsquo;s not long for this world;&rdquo; or, with a grin, &ldquo;I
      suppose you&rsquo;ve heard old Mr. Wheezington has had another attack in the
      night, which nearly carried him off.&rdquo; Nothing pleased her so much as being
      told that any one from whom she had expectations was on the wane. She
      could ill conceal her satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far so good; the party now numbered twelve, six of themselves and six
      strangers, and nobody to interfere with Fine Billy. The question then
      arose, whether to ask the Blurkinses, or the Faireys, or the Crickletons,
      and this caused an anxious deliberation. Blurkins was a landowner, over
      whose property the Major frequently hunted; but then on the other hand, he
      was a most disagreeable person, who would be sure to tread upon every
      body&rsquo;s corns before the evening was over. Indeed, the Blurkins&rsquo; family,
      like noxious vermin, would seem to have been sent into the world for some
      inscrutable purpose, their mission apparently being to take the conceit
      out of people by telling them home truths. &ldquo;Lor&rsquo; bless us! how old you
      have got! why you&rsquo;ve lost a front tooth! declare I shouldn&rsquo;t have known
      you!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Your nose and your chin have got into fearful proximity,&rdquo; was
      the sort of salute Blurkins would give an acquaintance after an absence.
      Or if the &ldquo;Featherbedfordshire Gazette,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Hit-im and Hold-im shire
      Herald&rdquo; had an unflattering paragraph respecting a party&rsquo;s interference at
      the recent elections, or on any other subject, Blurkins was the man who
      would bring it under his notice. &ldquo;There, sir, there; see what they say
      about you!&rdquo; he would say, coming up in the news-room, with the paper
      neatly folded to the paragraph, and presenting it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Faireys of Yarrow Court were the most producible people, but then Miss
      was a beauty, who had even presumed to vie with the Yammertons, and they
      could not ask the old people without her. Besides which, it had transpired
      that a large deal box, carefully covered with glazed canvas, had recently
      arrived at the Rosedale station, which it was strongly suspected contained
      a new dinner dress from Madame Glace&rsquo;s in Hanover Street; and it would
      never do to let her sport it at Yammerton Grange against their girl&rsquo;s
      rather soiled&mdash;but still by candle-light extremely passable&mdash;watered
      silk ones. So, after due deliberation, the Faireys were rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Crickletons&rsquo; claims were then taken into consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crick was the son of Crickleton, the late eminent chiropodist of Bolton
      Row, whom many of our readers will remember parading about London on his
      piebald pony, with a groom in a yellow coat, red plush breeches, and
      boots; and the present Crickleton was now what he called &ldquo;seeking repose&rdquo;
       in the country, which, in his opinion, consisted in setting all his
      neighbours by the ears. He rented Lavender Lodge and farm, and being a
      thorough Cockney, with a great inclination for exposing his ignorance both
      in the sporting and farming way, our knowing Major was making rather a
      good thing of him. At first there was a little rivalry between them, as to
      which was the greater man: Crickleton affirming that his father might have
      been knighted; the Major replying, that as long as he wasn&rsquo;t knighted it
      made no matter. The Major, however, finding it his interest to humour his
      consequence, compromised matters, by always taking in Mrs. Crickleton, a
      compliment that Crick returned by taking in Mrs. Yammerton. Though the
      Major used, when in the running-down tack, to laugh at the idea of a
      knight&rsquo;s son claiming precedence, yet, when on the running-up one, he used
      to intimate that his friend&rsquo;s father might have been knighted, and even
      sometimes assigned the honour to his friend himself. So he talked of him
      to our Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual preponderating influence setting in in favour of acceptances,
      our host and hostess were obliged to play their remaining card with
      caution. There were two sets of people with equal claims&mdash;the
      Impelows of Buckup Hill, and the Baskyfields of Lingworth Lawn; the
      Impelows, if anything, having the prior claim, inasmuch as the Yammertons
      had dined with them last; but then, on the other hand, there was a very
      forward young Impelow whom they couldn&rsquo;t accommodate, that is to say,
      didn&rsquo;t want to have; while, as regarded the Baskyfields, old Basky and
      Crickleton were at daggers drawn about a sow Basky had sold him, and they
      would very likely get to loggerheads about it during the evening. A plan
      of the table was drawn up, to see if it was possible to separate them
      sufficiently, supposing people would only have the sense to go to their
      right places, but it was found to be impracticable to do justice to their
      consequence, and preserve the peace as well; so the idea of having the
      Baskyfields was obliged to be relinquished. This delay was fatal to the
      Impelows, for John Giles, their man-of-all-work, having seen Solomon
      scouring the country on horseback with a basket, in search of superfluous
      poultry, had reported the forthcoming grand spread at the Grange to his
      &ldquo;Missis&rdquo;; and after waiting patiently for an invitation, it at length came
      so late as to be an evident convenience, which they wouldn&rsquo;t submit to; so
      after taking a liberal allowance of time to answer, in order to prevent
      the Yammertons from playing the same base trick upon any one else, they
      declined in a stiff, non-reason-assigning note. This was the first check
      to the hitherto prosperous current of events, and showed our sagacious
      friends that the time was past for stopping gaps with family people, and
      threw them on the other resources of the district.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual bachelor stop-gaps of the neighbourhood were Tom Hetherington,
      of Bearbinder Park, and Jimmy Jarperson, of Fothergill Burn, both of whom
      had their disqualifications; Jarperson&rsquo;s being an acute nerve-shaking sort
      of laugh, that set every one&rsquo;s teeth on edge who heard it, and earned for
      him the title of the Laughing Hyæna; the other&rsquo;s misfortune being, that he
      was only what may be called an intermediate gentleman, that is to say, he
      could act the gentleman up to a pint of wine or so, after which quantity
      nature gradually asserted her supremacy, and he became himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend Paul Straddler, of Hinton, at one time had had the call of them
      both, but the Major, considering that Straddler had not used due diligence
      in the matter of Golden-drop, was not inclined to have him. Besides which,
      Straddler required a bed, which the Major was not disposed to yield, a bed
      involving a breakfast, and perhaps a stall for his horse, to say nothing
      of an out-of-place groom Straddler occasionally adopted, and who could eat
      as much as any two men. So the Laughing Hyæna and Hetherington were
      selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, gentle reader, if you will have the kindness to tell them off on
      your fingers as we call them over, we will see if we have got country, and
      as many as ever the Major can cram into his diningroom. Please count:&mdash;

      All right! eighteen; fourteen for dining-room chairs, and four for bedroom

      CHAPTER XXI.<br/>THE GATHERING.&mdash;THE GRAND SPREAD ITSELF.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>F a dinner-party
      in town, with all the aids and appliances of sham-butlers, job-cooks,
      area-sneak-entrés, and extraneous confectionary, causes confusion in an
      establishment, how much more so must a party in the country, where, in
      addition to the guests, their servants, their horses, and their carriages,
      are to be accommodated. What a turning-out, and putting-up, and
      make-shifting, is there! What a grumbling and growling at not getting into
      the best stable, or at not having the state-vehicle put into the
      coach-house. If Solomon had not combined the wisdom of his namesake, with
      the patience of Job, he would have succumbed to the pressure from without.
      As it was, he kept persevering on until having got the last shandry-dan
      deposited under the hay house, he had just time to slip up-stairs to
      &ldquo;clean himself,&rdquo; and be ready to wait at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what a commotion the party makes in the kitchen! Everybody is in a
      state of stew, from the gallant Betty Bone down to the hind&rsquo;s little girl
      from Bonnyriggs Farm, whom they have &ldquo;got in&rdquo; for the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor do their anxieties end with the dishing-up of the dinner; for no
      sooner is it despatched, than that scarcely less onerous entertainment,
      the supper for the servants, has to be provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes the coffee, then the tea, then the tray, and then the carriages
      wanted, then good night, good night, good night; most agreeable evening;
      no idea it was so late; and getting away. But the heat, and steam, and
      vapour of the kitchen overpowers us, and we gladly seek refuge in the
      newly &ldquo;done-up&rdquo; drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In it behold the Major!&mdash;the Major in all the glory of the Yammerton
      harrier uniform, a myrtle-green coat, with a gold embroidered hare on the
      myrtle-green velvet collar, and puss with her ears well back, striding
      away over a dead gold surface, with a raised burnished rim of a button, a
      nicely-washed, stiffly-starched, white vest, with a yellow silk one
      underneath, black shorts, black silk stockings, and patent leather pumps.
      He has told off his very rare and singularly fine port wine, his prime old
      Madeira, matured in the West Indies; his nutty sherry, and excellently
      flavoured claret, all recently bought at the auction mart, not forgetting
      the ginger-pop-like champagne,&mdash;allowing the liberal measure of a
      pint for each person of the latter, and he is now trying to cool himself
      down into the easy-minded, unconcerned, every-day-dinner-giving host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Yammerton too, on whom devolves the care of the wax and the
      modérateurs, is here superintending her department&mdash;seeing that the
      hearth is properly swept, and distributing the Punches, and Posts, and
      &ldquo;Ask Mamma&rsquo;s&rdquo; judiciously over the fine variegated table-cover. She is
      dressed in a rich silvery grey&mdash;with a sort of thing like a silver
      cow tie, with full tassels, twisted and twined serpent-like into her full,
      slightly streaked, dark hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The illumination being complete, she seats herself fan in hand on the
      sofa, and a solemn pause then ensues, broken only by Billy&rsquo;s and
      Monsieur&rsquo;s meanderings over-head, and the keen whistle of the November
      wind careering among the hollies and evergreens which the Major keeps
      interpreting into wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his wife and he seek to relieve the suspense of the moment by
      speculating on who will come first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those nasty Tightlaces for a guinea,&rdquo; observed the Major, polishing his
      nails, while Mrs. Yammerton predicted the Larkspurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the Tights,&rdquo; reiterated the Major, jingling his silver; &ldquo;Tights
      always comes first&mdash;thinks to catch one unprepared&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length the furious bark of the inhospitable terrier, who really seemed
      as if he would eat horses, vehicle, visitors, and all, was followed by a
      quick grind up to the door, and such a pull at the bell as made the Major
      fear would cause it to suspend payment for good&mdash;<i>ring-ring-ring-ring-ring</i>
      it went, as if it was never going to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pulled the bell out of the socket, for a guinea,&rdquo; exclaimed the Major,
      listening for the letting down of steps, iron or recessed&mdash;recessed
      had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. D.&rdquo; said the Major&mdash;figuring her old Landaulet in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ladies</i> evidently,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Yammerton, as the rustle of silks
      on their way to the put-to-rights Sanctum, sounded past the drawing-room
      door. The Major then began speculating as to whether they would get
      announced before another arrival took place, or not.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ****
    </h3>
    <p>
      Presently a renewed rustle was succeeded by the now yellow-legged,
      brown-backed Bumbler, throwing open the door and exclaiming in a
      stentorian voice, as if he thought his master and mistress had turned
      suddenly deaf, &ldquo;Mrs. and Miss Dotherington!&rdquo; and in an instant the four
      were hugging, and grinning, and pump-handling each other&rsquo;s arms as if they
      were going into ecstacies, Mrs. Dotherington interlarding her gymnastics
      with Mrs. Yammerton, with sly squeezes of the hand, suited to <i>soto voce</i>
      observations not intended for the Major&rsquo;s ears, of &ldquo;so <i>&lsquo;appy</i> to ear
      it! so glad to congratulate you! <i>So nice!</i>&rdquo; with an inquisitive
      whisper of&mdash;&ldquo;<i>which is it? which is it?</i> Do tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      ****
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow</i> went the clamorous Fury again; <i>Ring-ring-ring-ring-ring-ring-ring</i>
      went the aggravated bell, half drowning Mrs. Yammerton&rsquo;s impressive &ldquo;O
      dear! nothin&rsquo; of the sort&mdash;nothin&rsquo; of the sort, only a fox-hunting
      acquaintance of the Major&rsquo;s&mdash;only a fox-hunting acquaintance of the
      Major&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And then the Major came to renew his affectionate embraces, with
      inquiries about the night, and the looks of the moon&mdash;was it hazy, or
      was it clear, or how was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Rocket Larkspur!&rdquo; exclaimed the Bumbler, following up the
      key-note in which he had pitched his first announcement and forthwith the
      hugging and grinning was resumed with the new comers, Mrs. Larkspur
      presently leading Mrs. Yammerton off sofawards, in order to poke her
      inquiries unheard by the Major, who was now opening a turnip dialogue with
      Mr. Rocket&mdash;yellow bullocks, purple tops, and so on. &ldquo;Well, tell me&mdash;<i>which
      is it?</i>&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Rocket Larkspur, looking earnestly, in Mrs.
      Yammerton&rsquo;s expressive eyes&mdash;&ldquo;<i>which is it,</i>&rdquo; repeated she, in a
      determined sort of take-no-denial tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! nothin&rsquo; of the sort&mdash;nothin&rsquo; of the sort, I assure you!&rdquo;
       whispered Mrs. Yammerton anxiously, well knowing the danger of holloaing
      before you are out of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>tell me&mdash;tell me</i>,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Rocket, coaxingly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not like Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;um there, looking at Mrs.
      Dotherington, who would blab it all over the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Really</i> I have nothing to tell,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Yammerton serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you mean to say he&rsquo;s not after one of the&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;um&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
       demanded Mrs. Rocket eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Yammerton.

    <p>
      <i>Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow</i> went the terrier again, giving Mrs.
      Yammerton an excuse for sidling off to Mrs. &ldquo;um,&rdquo; who with her daughter
      were lost in admiration at a floss silk cockatoo, perched on an orange
      tree, the production of Miss Flora. &ldquo;Oh, it was so beautiful! Oh, what a
      love of a screen it would make; what would she give if her Margaret could
      do such work,&rdquo; inwardly thinking how much better Margaret was employed
      making her own&mdash;we will not say what.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bow-wow-wow-wow-wow-wow</i> went Fury again, the proceeds of this bark
      being Mr. and Mrs. Tightlace, who now entered, the former &ldquo;&lsquo;oping they
      weren&rsquo;t late,&rdquo; as he smirked, and smiled, and looked round for the youth
      on whom he had to vent his &ldquo;British Sportsman&rdquo; knowledge&mdash;the latter
      speedily drawing Mrs. Yammerton aside&mdash;to the ladies know what. But
      it was &ldquo;no go&rdquo; again. Mrs. Yammerton really didn&rsquo;t know what Mrs.
      Tightlace meant. No; she <i>really</i> didn&rsquo;t. Nor did Mrs. Tightlace&rsquo;s
      assurance that it was &ldquo;the talk of the country,&rdquo; afford any clue to her
      meaning&mdash;but Mrs. Tightlace&rsquo;s large miniature brooch being luckily
      loose, Mrs. Yammerton essayed to fasten it, which afforded her an
      opportunity of bursting into transports of delight at its beauty, mingled
      with exclamations as to its &ldquo;<i>wonderful</i> likeness to Mr. T.,&rdquo; though
      in reality she was looking at Mrs. Tightlace&rsquo;s berthe, to see whether it
      was machinery lace, or real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the grand rush took place; and Fury&rsquo;s throat seemed wholly inadequate
      to the occasion, as first Blurkins&rsquo;s Brougham, then Jarperson&rsquo;s Gig, next
      the corn-cutter&rsquo;s <i>calèche</i>, and lastly, Hetherington&rsquo;s Dog-cart
      whisked up to the door, causing a meeting of the highly decorated watered
      silks of the house, and the hooded enveloped visitors hurrying through the
      passage to the cloak-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the young ladies had made their obeisances and got
      congratulated on their looks, the now metamorphosed visitors came trooping
      in, flourishing their laced kerchiefs, and flattening their <i>chapeaux
      mèchaniques</i> as they entered. Then the full chorus of conversation was
      established; moon, hounds, turnips, horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parliament, with the usual&mdash;&ldquo;Oi see by the papers that Her
      Majesty is gone to Osborne,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Oi see by the papers that
      the Comet is coming;&rdquo; while Mrs. Rocket Larkspur draws Miss
      Yammerton aside to try what she can fish out of her. But here comes Fine
      Billy, and if ever hero realised an author&rsquo;s description of him,
      assuredly it is our friend, for he sidles as unconcernedly into the room
      as he would into a Club or Casino, with all the dreamy listlessness of a
      thorough exquisite, apparently unconscious of any change having taken
      place in the party. But if Billy is unconscious of the presence of
      strangers, his host is not, and forthwith he inducts him into their
      acquaintance&mdash;Hetherington&rsquo;s, Hyæna&rsquo;s, and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is, doubtless, very flattering of great people to vote all the little
      ones &ldquo;one of us,&rdquo; and not introduce them to anybody, but we take leave to
      say, that society is considerably improved by a judicious presentation. We
      talk of our advanced civilisation, but manners are not nearly so good, or
      so &ldquo;at-ease-setting,&rdquo; as they were with the last generation of apparently
      stiffer, but in reality easier, more affable gentlemen of the old school.
      But what a note of admiration our Billy is! How gloriously he is attired.
      His naturally curling hair, how gracefully it flows; his elliptic collar,
      how faultlessly it stands; his cravat, how correct; his shirt, how
      wonderfully fine; and, oh! how happy he must be with such splendid
      sparkling diamond studs&mdash;such beautiful amethyst buttons at his
      wrists&mdash;and such a love of a chain disporting itself over his richly
      embroidered blood-stone-buttoned vest. Altogether, such a first-class
      swell is rarely seen beyond the bills of mortality. He looks as if he
      ought to be kept under a glass shade. But here comes the Bumbler, and now
      for the agony of the entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major, who for the last few minutes has been fidgetting about pairing
      parties off according to a written programme he has in his waistcoat
      pocket, has just time to assign Billy to Mrs. Rocket Larkspur, to assuage
      her anguish at not being taken in before Mrs. Crickleton, when the
      Bumbler&rsquo;s half-fledged voice is heard proclaiming at its utmost altitude&mdash;&ldquo;dinner
      is sarved!&rdquo; Then there is such a bobbing and bowing, and backing of
      chairs, and such inward congratulations, that the &ldquo;&lsquo;orrid &lsquo;alf&rsquo;our&rdquo; is
      over, and hopes from some that they may not get next the fire&mdash;while
      others wish to be there. Though the Major could not, perhaps, manage to
      get twenty thousand men out of Hyde Park, he can, nevertheless, manouvre a
      party out of his drawing-room into his dining-room, and forthwith he led
      the way, with Mrs. Crickleton under his arm, trusting to the reel winding
      off right at the end. And right it would most likely have wound off had
      not the leg-protruding Bumbler&rsquo;s tongue-buckle caught the balloon-like
      amplitude of Mrs. Rocket Larkspur&rsquo;s dress and caused a slight stoppage&mdash;in
      the passage,&mdash;during which time two couples slipped past and so
      deranged the entire order of the table. However, there was no great harm
      done, as far as Mrs. Larkspur&rsquo;s consequence was concerned, for she got
      next Mr. Tightlace, with Mr. Pringle between her and Miss Yammerton, whom
      Mrs. Larkspur had just got to admit, that she wouldn&rsquo;t mind being Mrs. P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and Miss having been thus confidential, Mrs. was inclined, partly out of
      gratitude,&mdash;partly, perhaps, because she couldn&rsquo;t help it&mdash;to
      befriend her. She was a great mouser, and would promote the most forlorn
      hope, sooner than not be doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now in the dining-room, and very smart everything is. In the centre
      of the table, of course, stands the Yammerton testimonial,&mdash;a
      &ldquo;Savory&rdquo; chased silver plated candelabrum, with six branches, all lighted
      up, and an ornamental centre flower-basket, decorated with evergreens and
      winter roses, presented to our friend on his completing his &ldquo;five and
      twentieth year as master of harriers,&rdquo; and in gratitude for the
      unparalleled sport he had uniformly shown the subscribers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Testimonialising has become quite a mania since the Major got his, and no
      one can say whose turn it may be next. It is not everybody who, like Mr.
      Daniel Whittle Harvey with the police force one, can nip them in the bud;
      but Inspector Field, we think, might usefully combine
      testimonial-detecting with his other secret services. He would have plenty
      to do&mdash;especially in the provinces. Indeed London does not seem to be
      exempt from the mania, if we may judge by Davis the Queen&rsquo;s huntsman&rsquo;s
      recent attempt to avert the intended honour; neatly informing the
      projectors that &ldquo;their continuing to meet him in the hunting field would
      be the best proof of their approbation of his conduct.&rdquo; However, the Major
      got his testimonial; and there it stands, flanked by two pretty imitation
      Dresden vases decorated with flowers and evergreens also. And now the
      company being at length seated and grace said, the reeking covers are
      removed from the hare and mock turtle tureens, and the confusion of
      tongues gradually subsides into sip-sip-sipping of soup. And now
      Jarperson, having told his newly caught footman groom to get him hare soup
      instead of mock turtle, the lad takes the plate of the latter up to the
      tureen of the former, and his master gets a mixture of both&mdash;which he
      thinks very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the nutty sherry comes round, which the Major introduces with a
      stuttering exordium that would induce anyone who didn&rsquo;t know him to
      suppose it cost at least 80s. a-dozen, instead of 36s. (bottles included);
      and this being sipped and smacked and pronounced excellent, &ldquo;two fishes&rdquo;
       replace the two soups, and the banquet proceeds, Mr. Tightlace trying to
      poke his sporting knowledge at Billy between heats, but without success,
      the commoner not rising at the bait, indeed rather shirking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long-necked green bottle of what the Bumbler called &ldquo;bluecellas,&rdquo; then
      goes its rounds; and the first qualms of hunger being appeased, the
      gentlemen are more inclined to talk and listen to the luncheon-dining
      ladies. Mrs. Rocket Larkspur has been waiting most anxiously for Billy&rsquo;s
      last mouthful, in order to interrogate him, as well as to London fashion,
      as to his opinions of the Miss &ldquo;ums.&rdquo; Of course with Miss &ldquo;um&rdquo; sitting
      just below Billy, the latter must be done through the medium of the
      former,&mdash;so she leads off upon London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She supposed he&rsquo;d been very gay in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; drawled Billy in the true dandified style, drawing his napkin
      across his lips as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rocket wasn&rsquo;t so young as she had been, and Billy was too young to
      take up with what he profanely called &ldquo;old ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d live at the west-end, she s&rsquo;posed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, feeling his amplified tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he know Billiter Square?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied he, running his ringed fingers down his studs. &ldquo;Was it
      fashionable?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Rocket. (She had a cousin lived there who had
      asked her to go and see her.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-a-a-rse, I should say it is,&rdquo; drawled Billy, now playing with a bunch
      of trinkets, a gold miniature pistol, a pearl and diamond studded locket,
      a gold pencil-case, and a white cornelian heart, suspended to his
      watch-chain. &ldquo;Y-a-a-rse, I should say it is,&rdquo; repeated he; adding &ldquo;not so
      fashionable as Belgrave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sceuse me, sare,&rdquo; interrupted Monsieur Jean Rougier from behind his
      master&rsquo;s chair, &ldquo;Sceuse me, it is not fashionable, sare,&mdash;it is not
      near de Palace or de Park of Hyde, sare, bot down away among those dem
      base mechanics in de east&mdash;beyond de Mansion &lsquo;Ouse, in fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ah, y-a-a-rse, true,&rdquo; replied Billy, not knowing where it was, but
      presuming from Mrs. Larkspur&rsquo;s inquiry that it was some newly sprung-up
      square on one of the western horns of the metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking advantage of the interruption, Mr. Tightlace again essayed to edge
      in his &ldquo;British Sportsman&rdquo; knowledge beginning with an inquiry if &ldquo;the
      Earl of Ladythorne had a good set of dogs this season?&rdquo; but the Bumbler
      soon cut short the thread of his discourse by presenting a bottle of brisk
      gooseberry at his ear. The fizzing stuff then went quickly round, taxing
      the ingenuity of the drinkers to manoeuvre the frothy fluid out of their
      needlecase-shaped glasses. Then as conversation was beginning to be
      restored, the door suddenly flew open to a general rush of returning
      servants. There was Soloman carrying a sirloin of beef, followed by Mr.
      Crickleton&rsquo;s gaudy red-and-yellow young man with a boiled turkey, who in
      turn was succeeded by Mr. Rocket Larkspur&rsquo;s hobbledehoy with a ham, and
      Mr. Tightlace&rsquo;s with a stew. Pâtés and côtelettes, and minces, and messes
      follow in quick succession; and these having taken their seats,
      immediately vacate them for the Chiltern-hundreds of the hand. A shoal of
      vegetables and sundries alight on the side table, and the feast seems
      fairly under weigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But see! somehow it prospers not!
    </p>
    <p>
      People stop short at the second or third mouthful, and lay down their
      knives and forks as if they had had quite enough. Patties, and cutlets,
      and sausages, and side-dishes, all share the same fate!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take round the champagne,&rdquo; says the Major, with an air, thinking to
      retrieve the character of his kitchen with the solids. The juicy roast
      beef, and delicate white turkey with inviting green stulling, and rich red
      ham, and turnip-and-carrot-adorned stewed beef then made their progresses,
      but the same fate attends them also. People stop at the second or third
      mouthful;&mdash;some send their plates away slily, and ask for a little of
      a different dish to what they have been eating, or rather tasting. That,
      however, shares the same fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take round the champagne,&rdquo; again says the Major, trying what another
      cheerer would do. Then he invites the turkey-eaters&mdash;or leavers,
      rather&mdash;to eat beef; and the beef eaters&mdash;or leavers&mdash;to
      eat turkey: but they all decline with a thoroughly satisfied
      &lsquo;no-more-for-me&rsquo; sort of shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take away!&rdquo; at length says the Major, with an air of disgust, following
      the order with an invitation to Mrs. Rocket Larkspur to take wine. The
      guests follow the host&rsquo;s example, and a momentary rally of liveliness
      ensues. Mrs. Rocket Larkspur and Mr. Tightlace contend for Fine Billy&rsquo;s
      ear; but Miss Yammerton interposing with a sly whisper supersedes them
      both. Mrs. Rocket construes that accordingly. A general chirp of
      conversation is presently established, interspersed with heavy demands
      upon the breadbasket by the gentlemen. Presently the door is thrown open,
      and a grand procession of sweets enters&mdash;jellies, blancmanges, open
      tarts, shut tarts, meringues, plum pudding, maccaroni, black puddings,&mdash;we
      know not what besides: and the funds of conviviality again look up. The
      rally is, however, but of momentary duration. The same evil genius that
      awaited on the second course seems to attend on the third. People stop at
      the second or third mouthful and send away the undiminished plates slily,
      as before. Some venture on other dishes&mdash;but the result is the same&mdash;the
      plate vanishes with its contents. There is, however, a great run upon the
      cheese&mdash;Cheshire and Gloucester; and the dessert suffers severely.
      All the make-weight dishes, even, disappear; and when the gentlemen rejoin
      the ladies in the drawing-room they attack the tea as if they had not had
      any dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length a &ldquo;most agreeable evening&rdquo; is got through; and as each group
      whisks away, there is a general exclamation of &ldquo;What a most extraordinary
      taste everything had of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; What do you
      think, gentle reader?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t guess! can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Mrs. Brown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think, Mrs. Jones?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you, Mrs. Robinson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! none of you able to guess! And yet everybody at table hit off
      directly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All give it up?&rdquo; Brown, Jones, and Robinson?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, we&rsquo;ll tell you&rdquo;:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything tasted of Castor oil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Castor oil!</i>&rdquo; exclaims Mrs. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Castor oil!&rdquo; shrieks Mrs. Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Castor oil!&rdquo; shudders Mrs. Robinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-o-o-o! how nasty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how came it there?&rdquo; asks Mrs. Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell you that, too&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major&rsquo;s famous cow Strawberry-cream&rsquo;s calf was ill, and they had
      tapped a pint of fine &ldquo;cold-drawn&rdquo; for it, which Monsieur Jean Rougier
      happening to upset, just mopped it up with his napkin, and chucking it
      away, it was speedily adopted by the hind&rsquo;s little girl in charge of the
      plates and dishes, who imparted a most liberal castor oil flavour to
      everything she touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that entertainment is now known by the name of the &ldquo;Castor Oil
      Dinner.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII.<br/>A HUNTING MORNING.&mdash;UNKENNELING.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT a commotion
      there was in the house the next morning! As great a disturbance as if the
      Major had been going to hunt an African Lion, a royal Bengal Tiger, or a
      Bison itself. <i>Ring-ring-ring-ring</i> went one bell, <i>tinkle-tinkle-tinkle</i>
      went another, <i>ring-ring-ring</i> went the first again, followed by
      exclamations of &ldquo;There&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s bell again!&rdquo; with such a running down
      stairs, and such a getting up again. Master wanted this, master wanted
      that, master had carried away the buttons at his knees, master wanted his
      other pair of White what-do-they-call-ems&mdash;not cords, but moleskins&mdash;that
      treacherous material being much in vogue among masters of harriers. Then
      master&rsquo;s boots wouldn&rsquo;t do, he wanted his last pair, not the newly-footed
      ones, and they were on the trees, and the Bumbler was busy in the stable,
      and Betty Bone could not skin the trees, and altogether there was a
      terrible hubbub in the house. His overnight exertions, though coupled with
      the castor oil catastrophe, seemed to have abated none of his ardour in
      pursuit of the hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile our little dandy, Billy, lay tumbling and tossing in bed,
      listening to the dread preparations, wishing he could devise an excuse for
      declining to join him. The recollection of his bumps, and his jumps, and
      his falls, arose vividly before him, and he would fain have said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to
      any more. He felt certain that the Major was going to give him a startler,
      more dreadful perhaps than those he had had with his lordship. Would that
      he was well out of it! What pleasure could there be in galloping after an
      animal they could shoot? In the midst of these reflections Mons. Rougier
      entered the apartment and threw further light on the matter by opening the
      shutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sall get up, sare, and pursue the vild beast of de voods&mdash;de
      Major is a-goin&rsquo; to hont.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-a-r-se,&rdquo; replied Billy, turning over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sal get out your habit verd, your green coat, dat is to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No! no!</i>&rdquo; roared Billy; &ldquo;<i>the red! the red!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>De red!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Monsieur in astonishment, &ldquo;de red Not for de
      soup dogs! you only hont bold reynard in de red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do,&rdquo; retorted Billy, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t the Major come to the carstle
      in red?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he came to hont de fox,&rdquo; replied Monsieur; &ldquo;if he had com&rsquo; for to
      hont poor puss he would &lsquo;ave &lsquo;ad on his green or his grey, or his some
      other colour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy now saw the difference, and his mortification increased. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll
      breakfast in red at all events,&rdquo; said he, determined to have that
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, sare, you can pleasure yourself in dat matter; but it sall be moch
      ridicule if you pursue de puss in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not?&rdquo; asked Billy, &ldquo;hunting&rsquo;s hunting, all the world over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you vy, sir; but it is not <i>etiquette</i>, and I as a
      professor of garniture, toggery vot you call, sid lose <i>caste</i> with
      my comrades if I lived with a me lor vot honted poor puss in de pink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Humph!</i>&rdquo; grunted Billy, bouncing out of bed, thinking what a bore
      it was paying a man for being his master. He then commenced the operations
      of the occasion, and with the aid of Monsieur was presently attired in the
      dread costume. He then clonk, clonk, clonked down stairs with his
      Jersey-patterned spurs, toes well out to clear the steps, most heartily
      wishing he was clonking up again on his return from the hunt.

      Monsieur was right. The Major is in his myrtle-green coat&mdash;a coat,
      not built after the fashion of the scanty swallow-tailed red in which he
      appears at page 65 of this agreeable work, but with the more liberal
      allowance of cloth peculiar to the period in which we live. A loosely
      hanging garment, and not a strait-waistcoat, in fact, a fashion very much
      in favour of bunglers, seeing that anybody can make a sack, while it takes
      a tailor to make a coat. The Major&rsquo;s cost him about two pounds five, the
      cloth having been purchased at a clothier&rsquo;s and made up at home, by a
      three shilling a day man and his meat. We laugh at the ladies for liking
      to be cheated by their milliners; but young gentlemen are quite as
      accommodating to their tailors. Let any man of forty look at his tailor&rsquo;s
      bill when he was twenty, and see what a liberality of innocence it
      displays. And that not only in matters of taste and fashion, which are the
      legitimate loopholes of extortion, but in the sober articles of ordinary
      requirement. We saw a once-celebrated west-end tailor&rsquo;s bill the other
      day, in which a plain black coat was made to figure in the following
      magniloquent item:&mdash;

      &ldquo;A superfine black cloth coat, lappels sewed on&rdquo; (we wonder if they are
      usually pinned or glued) &ldquo;lappels sewed on, cloth collar, cotton sleeve
      linings, velvet handfacings,&rdquo; (most likely cotton too,) &ldquo;embossed edges
      and fine wove buttons&rdquo;&mdash;how much does the reader think? four guineas?
      four pound ten? five guineas? No, five pound eighteen and sixpence! An
      article that our own excellent tailor supplies for three pounds fifteen!
      In a tailor&rsquo;s case that was recently tried, a party swore that fourteen
      guineas was a fair price for a Taglioni, when every body knows that they
      are to be had for less than four. But boys will be boys to the end of the
      chapter, so let us return to our sporting Major. He is not so happy in his
      nether garments as he is in his upper ones; indeed he has on the same
      boots and moleskins that Leech drew him in at Tantivy Castle, for these
      lower habiliments are not so easy of accomplishment in the country as
      coats, and though most people have tried them there, few wear them out,
      they are always so ugly and unbecoming. As, however, our Major doesn&rsquo;t
      often compare his with town-made ones, he struts about in the comfortable
      belief that they are all right&mdash;very smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is now in a terrible stew, and has been backwards and forwards between
      the house and the stable, and in and out of the kennel, and has called
      Solomon repeatedly from his work to give him further instructions and
      further instructions still, until the Major has about confused himself and
      every body about him. As soon as ever he heard by his tramp overhead that
      Billy had got into his boots, he went to the bottom of the stairs and
      holloaed along the passage towards the kitchen. &ldquo;Betty! Betty! Betty! send
      in breakfast as soon as ever Mr. Pringle comes down!&rdquo;&rsquo; &ldquo;Ah, dere is de
      Majur.&rdquo; observed Monsieur, pausing from Billy&rsquo;s hair-arranging to listen&mdash;&ldquo;him
      kick up dc deval&rsquo;s own dost on a huntin&rsquo; mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened him?&rdquo; asked Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know&mdash;but von vould think he was going to storm a city&mdash;take
      Sebastopol himself,&rdquo; replied Monsieur, shrugging his broad shoulders. He
      then resumed his valeting operations, and crowned the whole by putting
      Billy into his green cut-away, without giving him even a peep of the pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mrs. Yammerton has been holding a court of inquiry in the
      kitchen and larder, as to the extent of the overnight mischief, smelling
      at this dish and that, criticising the spoons, and subjecting each
      castor-oily offender to severe ablution in boiling water. Of course no one
      could tell in whose hands the bottle of &ldquo;cold drawn&rdquo; had come &ldquo;in two,&rdquo;
       and Monsieur was too good a judge to know anything about it; so as the
      mischief couldn&rsquo;t be repaired, it was no use bewailing it farther than to
      make a knot in her mind to be more careful of such dangerous commodities
      in future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty Bone had everything&mdash;tea, coffee, bread, cakes, eggs, ham
      (fried so as to hide the spurious flavour), honey, jam, &amp;c., ready for
      Miss Benson, who had been impressed into the carrying service, <i>vice</i>
      the Bumbler turned whip, to take in as soon as Mr. Pringle descended, a
      fact that was announced to the household by the Major&rsquo;s uproarious
      greeting of him in the passage. He was overjoyed to see him! He hoped he
      was none the worse for his over-night festivities; and without waiting for
      an answer to that, he was delighted to say that it was a fine hunting
      morning, and as far as human judgment could form an opinion, a good
      scenting one; but after five-and-thirty years&rsquo; experience as a master of
      &ldquo;haryers,&rdquo; he could conscientiously say that there was nothing so doubtful
      or ticklish as scent, and he made no doubt Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s experience would
      confirm his own, that many days when they might expect it to be
      first-rate, it was bad, and many days when they might expect it to be bad,
      it was first-rate; to all which accumulated infliction Billy replied with
      his usual imperturbable &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; and passed on to the more agreeable
      occupation of greeting the young ladies in the dining-room. Very glad they
      all were to see him as he shook hands with all three.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major, however, was not to be put off that way; and as he could not
      get Billy to talk about hunting, he drew his attention to breakfast,
      observing that they had a goodish trot before them, and that punctuality
      was the politeness of princes. Saying which, he sat down, laying his great
      gold watch open on a plate beside him, so that its noisy ticking might
      remind Billy of what they had to do. The Major couldn&rsquo;t make it out how it
      was that the souls of the young men of the present day are so difficult to
      inflame about hunting. Here was he, turned of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      and as eager in the pursuit as ever. &ldquo;Must be that they smoke all their
      energies out,&rdquo; thought he; and then applied himself vigorously to his tea
      and toast, looking up every now and then with irate looks at his wife and
      daughters, whose volubility greatly retarded Billy&rsquo;s breakfast
      proceedings. He, nevertheless, made sundry efforts to edge in a hunting
      conversation himself, observing that Mr. Pringle mustn&rsquo;t expect such an
      establishment as the Peer&rsquo;s, or perhaps many that he was accustomed to&mdash;that
      they would have rather a shortish pack out, which would enable them to
      take the field again at an early day, and so on; all of which Billy
      received with the most provoking indifference, making the Major wish he
      mightn&rsquo;t be a regular crasher, who cared for nothing but riding. At
      length, tea, toast, eggs, ham, jam, all had been successively taxed, the
      Major closed and pocketed his noisy watch, and the doomed youth rose to
      perform the dread penance with the pack. &ldquo;Good byes,&rdquo; &ldquo;good mornings,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;hope you&rsquo;ll have good sport,&rdquo; followed his bowing spur-clanking exit from
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud crack of the Major&rsquo;s hammer-headed whip now announced their arrival
      in the stable-yard, which was at once a signal for the hounds to raise a
      merry cry, and for the stable-men to loosen their horses&rsquo; heads from the
      pillar-reins. It also brought a bevy of caps and curl-papers to the back
      windows of the house to see the young Earl, for so Rougier had assured
      them his master was&mdash;(heir to the Earldom of Ladythorne)&mdash;mount.
      At a second crack of the whip the stable-door flew open, and as a
      shirt-sleeved lad receded, the grey-headed, green-coated sage Solomon
      advanced, leading forth the sleek, well-tended, well-coddled, Napoleon the
      Great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the various offices filled by this Mathews-at-home of a servant,
      there was none perhaps in which he looked better or more natural than in
      that of a huntsman. Short, spare, neat, with a bright black eye,
      contrasting with the sobered hue of his thin grey hair, no one would
      suppose that the calfless little yellow and brown-liveried coachman of the
      previous night was the trim, neatly-booted, neatly-tied huntsman now
      raising his cap to the Richest Commoner in England, and his great master
      Major Yammerton&mdash;Major of the Featherbedfordshire Militia, master of
      &ldquo;haryers,&rdquo; and expectant magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Solomon,&rdquo; said the Major, acknowledging his salute, as though it
      was their first meeting of the morning, &ldquo;well, Solomon, what do you think
      of the day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I think the day&rsquo;s well enough,&rdquo; replied Solomon, who was no
      waster of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; said the Major, drawing on his clean doeskin gloves. The
      pent-up hounds then raised another cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pretty!&rdquo; exclaimed the Major listening
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>beautiful!</i>&rdquo; added he, like an enthusiastic admirer of music
      at the opera.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperturbable Billy spoke not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pr&rsquo;aps you&rsquo;d like to see them unkenneled?&rdquo; said the Major, thinking to
      begin with the first act of the drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, feeling safe as long as he was on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major then led the way through a hen-house-looking door into a little
      green court-yard, separated by peeled larch palings from a flagged one
      beyond, in which the expectant pack were now jumping and frisking and
      capering in every species of wild delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you beauties!&rdquo; exclaimed the Major, again cracking his whip. He then
      paused, thinking there would surely be a little praise. But no; Billy just
      looked at them as he would at a pen full of stock at a cattle show.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be-be-beauties, ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; stuttered the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy; thinking they were prettier than the great
      lounging, slouching foxhounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ca-ca-capital hounds,&rdquo; observed the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      No response from Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undeniable b-b-blood,&rdquo; continued our friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      No response again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-f-foxhounds in mi-mi-miniature,&rdquo; observed the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, who understood that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely! Lovely! Lovely! there&rsquo;s a beautiful bitch,&rdquo; continued the Major,
      pointing to a richly pied one that began frolicking to his call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bracelet! Bracelet! Bracelet!&rdquo; holloaed he to another; &ldquo;pretty bitch that&mdash;pure
      Sir Dashwood King&rsquo;s blood, just the right size for a haryer&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t
      be too large. I hold with So-so-somerville,&rdquo; continued the Major, waxing
      warm, either with his subject, or at Billy&rsquo;s indifference, &ldquo;that one
      should
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
‘A di-di-different hound for every chase
Select with judgment; nor the timorous hare,
O&rsquo;ermatch&rsquo;d, destroy; but leave that vile offence
To the mean, murderous, coursing crew, intent
On blood and spoil.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, turning on his heel as though he had had enough of
      the show.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, the Major drew the bolt, open flew the door, and out
      poured the pack; Ruffler and Bustler dashing at Billy, and streaking his
      nice cream-coloured leathers down with their dirty paws, while Thunder and
      Victim nearly carried him off his legs with the couples. Billy was in a
      great fright, never having been in such a predicament before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major came to the rescue, and with the aid of his whip and his voice,
      and his &ldquo;for shame, Ruffler! for shame, Bustler!&rdquo; with cuts at the coupled
      ones, succeeded in restoring order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s mount,&rdquo; said he, thinking to get Billy out of further danger; so
      saying he wheeled about and led the way through the outer yard with the
      glad pack gamboling and frisking around him to the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hounds raise a fresh cry of joy as they see Solomon with his horse
      ready to receive them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.<br/>SHOWING A HORSE.&mdash;THE MEET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Bumbler, like
      our Mathews-at-home of a huntsman, is now metamorphosed, and in lieu of a
      little footman, we have a capped and booted whip. Not that he <i>is</i> a
      whip, for Solomon carries the couples as well as the horn, and also a
      spare stirrup-leather slung across his shoulder; but our Major has an eye
      as well to show as to business, and thinks he may as well do the
      magnificent, and have a horse ready to change with Billy as soon as
      Napoleon the Great seems to have had enough. To that end the Bumbler now
      advances with the Weaver which he tenders to Billy, with a deferential
      touch of his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s <i>your</i> horse!&rdquo; exclaimed the Major, making for White
      Surrey, to avoid the frolics and favours of his followers; adding, as he
      climbed on, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find her a ca-ca-capital hack and a first-rate hunter.
      Here, <i>elope, hounds, elope!</i>&rdquo; added he, turning his horse&rsquo;s head
      away to get the course clear for our friend to mount unmolested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy then effects the ascent of the black mare, most devoutly wishing
      himself safe off again. The stirrups being adjusted to his length, he
      gives a home thrust with his feet in the irons, and gathering the thin
      reins, feels his horse gently with his left leg, just as Solomon mounts
      Napoleon the Great and advances to relieve the Major of his charge. The
      cavalcade then proceed; Solomon, with the now clustering hounds, leading;
      the Major and Billy riding side by side, and the Bumbler on Bulldog
      bringing up the rear. Caps and curl-papers then disappear to attend to the
      avocations of the house, the wearers all agreeing that Mr. Pringle is a
      very pretty young gentleman, and quite worthy of the pick of the young
      ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing Cowslip garth at an angle they get upon Greenbat pasture, where
      the first fruits of idleness are shown by Twister and Towler breaking away
      at the cows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Yow, yow!</i>&rdquo; they go in the full enjoyment of the chase. It&rsquo;s a
      grand chance for the Bumbler, who, adjusting his whip-thong, sticks spurs
      into Bulldog and sets off as hard as ever the old horse can lay legs to
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get round them, man! get round them,&rdquo; shouts the Major, watching Bully&rsquo;s
      leg-tied endeavours, the old horse being a better hand at walking than
      galloping.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they are stopped and chided and for shamed, and two more fields
      land our party in Hollington lane, which soon brings them into the
      Lingytine and Ewehurst-road, whose liberal width and ample siding bespeaks
      the neighbourhood of a roomier region. Solomon at a look from the Major
      now takes the grass siding with his hounds, while the gallant master just
      draws his young friend alongside of them on the road, casting an
      unconcerned eye upon the scene, in the hope that his guest will say
      something handsome at last. But no, Billy doesn&rsquo;t. He is fully occupied
      with his boots and breeches, whose polish and virgin purity he still
      deplores. There&rsquo;s a desperate daub down one side. The Major tries to
      engage his attention by coaxing and talking to the hounds. &ldquo;Cleaver, good
      dog! Cleaver! Chaunter, good dog! Chaunter!&rdquo; throwing them bits of
      biscuit, but all his efforts are vain. Billy plods on at the old post-boy
      pace, apparently thinking of nothing but himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Solomon ambles cockily along on Napoleon, with a backward and
      forward move of his leg to the horse&rsquo;s action, who ducks and shakes his
      head and plays good-naturedly with the hounds, as if quite delighted at
      the idea of what they are going to do. He shows to great advantage. He has
      not been out for a week, and the coddling and linseeding have given a
      healthy bloom to his bay coat, and he has taken a cordial ball with a
      little catechu, and ten grains of opium, to aid his exertions. Solomon,
      too, shows him off well. Though he hasn&rsquo;t our friend Dicky Boggledike&rsquo;s
      airified manner, like him he is little and light, sits neatly in his
      saddle, while his long coat-lap partly conceals the want of ribbing home
      of the handsome but washy horse. His boots and breeehes, drab cords and
      brown tops, are good, so are his spurs, also his saddle and bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a difference of twenty per cent, between the looks of a horse in
      a good, well-made London saddle, and in one of those great, spongy, pulby,
      puddingy things we see in the country. Again, what a contrast there is
      between a horse looking through a nice plain-fronted, plain-buckled,
      thin-reined, town-made bridle, and in one of those gaudy-fronted things,
      all over buckles, with reins thick enough for traces to the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s
      coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this adornment, however, is wasted upon fine Billy, who hasn&rsquo;t got
      beyond the mane and tail beauties of a horse. Action, strength, stamina,
      symmetry, are as yet sealed subjects to him. The Major was the man who
      could enlighten him, if Billy would only let him do it, on the two words
      for himself and one for Billy principle. Do it he would, too, for he saw
      it was of no use waiting for Billy to begin.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice &lsquo;oss that,&rdquo; now observed the Major casually, nodding towards Nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, looking him over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the o-o-oss I showed you in the stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; observed Billy, who didn&rsquo;t recognize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ought to be at M-m-melton, that oss,&rdquo; observed the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked Billy, in the innocence of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the Major carelessly, with a toss of his head;
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t know. The fact is, I&rsquo;m idle&mdash;no one to send with him&mdash;too
      old to go myself&mdash;haryers keep me at home&mdash;year too short to do
      all one has to do&mdash;see what a length he is&mdash;ord bless us he&rsquo;d go
      over Ashby p-p-pastures like a comet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy had now got his eyes well fixed upon the horse, which the Major
      seeing held his peace, for he was a capital seller, and had the great gift
      of knowing when he had said enough. He was not the man to try and bore a
      person into buying, or spoil his market by telling a youngster that the
      horse would go in harness, or by not asking enough. So with Solomon still
      to and froing with his little legs, the horse still lively and gay, the
      hounds still frisking and playing, the party proceeded through the
      fertility-diminishing country, until the small fields with live fences
      gradually gave way to larger, drabber enclosures with stone walls, and
      Broadstruther hill with its heath-burnt summit and quarry broken side at
      length announces their approach to the moors. The moors! Who does not feel
      his heart expand and his spirit glow as he comes upon the vast ocean-like
      space of moorland country? Leaving the strife, the cares, the contentions
      of a narrow, elbow-jostling world for the grand enjoyment of pure
      unrestricted freedom! The green streak of fertile soil, how sweet it
      looks, lit up by the fitful gleam of a cloud-obscured sun, the distant
      sky-touching cairn, how tempting to reach through the many intricacies of
      mountain ground&mdash;so easy to look at, so difficult to travel. The ink
      rises gaily in our pen at the thought, and pressing on, we cross the
      rough, picturesque, stone bridge over the translucent stream, so unlike
      the polished, chiseled structures of town art, where nothing is thought
      good that is not expensive; and now, shaking off the last enclosure, we
      reach the sandy road below the watcher&rsquo;s hill-ensconced hut, and so wind
      round into the panorama of the hills within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there we are!&rdquo; exclaimed the Major, now pointing out the myrtle-green
      gentlemen with their white cords, moving their steeds to and fro upon the
      bright sward below the grey rocks of Cushetlaw hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There we are,&rdquo; repeated he, eyeing them, trying to make out who they
      were, so as to season his greetings accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was farmer Rintoul on the white, and Godfrey Faulder, the cattle
      jobber, on the grey; and Caleb Bennison, the horse-breaker, in his
      twilled-fustian frock, ready to ride over a hound as usual; and old
      Duffield, the horse-leech, in his low-crowned hat, black tops, and one
      spur; and Dick Trail, the auctioneer, on his long-tailed nag; and Bonnet,
      the billiard-table keeper of Hinton, in his odious white hat, grey tweed,
      and collar-marked screw; but who the cluster of men are on the left the
      Major can&rsquo;t for the life of him make out. He had hoped that Crickleton
      might have graced the meet with his presence, but there is no symptom of
      the yellow-coated groom, and Paul Straddler would most likely be too
      offended at not being invited to dine and have gone to Sir Moses&rsquo;s hounds
      at the Cow and Calf on the Fixton and Primrose-bank road. Still there were
      a dozen or fourteen sportsmen, with two or three more coming over the
      hill, and distance hiding the deficiencies as well of steeds as of
      costume, the whole has a very lively and inspiriting effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the joyous, well-known &ldquo;here they come!&rdquo; of the lookers out, a move is
      perceptible among the field, who forthwith set off to meet the hounds, and
      as the advancing parties near, the Major has time to identify and
      appropriate their faces and their persons. First comes Captain Nabley, the
      chief constable of Featherbeds, who greets our master with the
      friendliness of a brother soldier, &ldquo;one of us&rdquo; in arms, and is forthwith
      introduced to our Billy. Next is fat farmer Nettlefold, who considers
      himself entitled to a shake of the hand in return for the Major&rsquo;s frequent
      comings over his farm at Carol-hill green, which compliment being duly
      paid the great master then raises his hat in return for the salutes of
      Faulder, Rennison, and Trail, and again stops to shake hands with an aged
      well-whiskered dandy in mufty, one Mr. Wotherspoon, now farming or
      starving a little property he purchased with his butlerage savings under
      the great Duke of Thunderdownshire. Wotherspoon apes the manners of high
      life with the brandified face of low, talks parliament, and takes snuff
      from a gold box with a George-the-Fourthian air. He now offers the Major a
      pinch, who accepts it with graceful concession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seedy-looking gentleman in black, on the too palpable three and
      sixpence a sider, is Mr. Catoheside, the County Court bailiff, with his
      pocket full of summonses, who thinks to throw a round with the Major into
      the day&rsquo;s hire of his broken-knee&rsquo;d chestnut, and the greasy-haired,
      shining-faced youth with him, on the longtailed white pony, is Ramshaw,
      the butcher&rsquo;s boy, on the same sort of speculation. Then we have Mr.
      Meggison&rsquo;s coachman availing himself of his master&rsquo;s absence to give the
      family horse a turn with the hounds instead of going to coals, as he
      ought; and Mr. Dotherington&rsquo;s young man halting on his way to the doctor&rsquo;s
      with a note. He will tell his mistress the doctor was out and he had to
      wait ever so long till he came home. The four truants seem to herd
      together on the birds-of-a-feather principle. And now the reinforced party
      reach the meet below the grey ivy-tangled rocks, and Solomon pulls up at
      the accustomed spot to give his hounds a roll, and let the Major receive
      the encomiums of the encircling field. Then there is a repetition of the
      kennel scene: &ldquo;Lovely! Lovely! Lovely!&mdash;beautiful bitch that&mdash;Chaunter.
      Chaunter! Chaunter!&mdash;there&rsquo;s a handsome hound&mdash;Bustler, good
      dog!&rdquo; Only each man has his particular favourite or hound that he has
      either bred or walked, or knows the name of, and so most of the pack come
      in for more or less praise. It is agreed on all hands that they never
      looked better, or the establishment more complete. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better if
      it had cost five thousand a-year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most grateful were their commendations to the Major after the dry,
      monotonous &ldquo;yarses&rdquo; of Billy, who sits looking unconcernedly on, a regular
      sleeping partner in the old established firm of &ldquo;Laudation and Co.&rdquo; The
      Major inwardly attributes his indifference to conceited fox-hunting pride.
      &ldquo;Looks down upon haryers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The field, however, gradually got the steam of praise up to a very high
      pitch. Indeed, had not Mr. Wotherspoon, who was only an air-and-exercise
      gentleman, observed, after a pompous pinch of snuff, that he saw by the
      papers that the House of Lords, of which he considered himself a sort of
      supernumerary member, were going to do something or not to do something,
      caused a check in the cry, there is no saying but they might altogether
      have forgotten what they had come out about. As it was, the mention of Mr.
      Wotherspoon&rsquo;s favourite branch of the legislature, from which they had all
      suffered more or less severely, operated like the hose of a fire-engine
      upon a crowd, sending one man one way, another another, until Wotherspoon
      had only Solomon and the hounds to finish off before. &ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; was
      all the encouragement he got from Solomon. But let us get away from the
      insufferable Brummagem brandy-faced old bore by supposing Solomon
      transferred from Napoleon the Great to Bulldog, Billy mounted on the washy
      horse instead of the weaving mare, the Major&rsquo;s girths drawn, clay pipes
      deposited in the breast pockets of the owners, and thongs unloosened to
      commence the all-important operation of thistle-whipping.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a nod from the Major, Solomon gives a wave of his hand to the hounds,
      and putting his horse on, the tide of sportsmen sweep after, and Cushetlaw
      rocks are again left in their pristine composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite Billy&rsquo;s indifference, the Major is still anxious to show to
      advantage, not knowing who Billy may relate his day&rsquo;s sport to, and has
      therefore arranged with Solomon not to cast off until they get upon the
      more favourable ground of Sunnylaws moor. This gives Billy time to settle
      in his new saddle, and scrape acquaintance with Napoleon, whom he finds a
      very complacent, easy-going horse. He has a light, playful mouth, and
      Billy doesn&rsquo;t feel afraid of him. Indeed, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the idea of the
      jumps, he would rather enjoy it. His mind, however, might have been easy
      on that score, for they are going into the hills instead of away from
      them, and the Major has scuttled over the ground so often that he knows
      every bog, and every crossing, and every vantage-taking line; where to
      view the hare, and where to catch up his hounds, to a nicety.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they reached a pretty, amphitheatreish piece of country,
      encircled by grassy hills, folding gracefully into each other, with the
      bolder outline of the Arkenhill moors for the background. A silvery stream
      meanders carelessly about the lowland, occasionally lost to view by sand
      wreaths and gravel beds thrown up by impetuous torrents rushing down from
      the higher grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field is here reinforced by Tom Springer, the generally out-of-place
      watcher, and his friend Joe Pitfall, the beer-shop keeper of Wetten hill,
      with their tenpenny wide-awakes, well-worn, baggy-pocketed shooting-coats,
      and strong oak staffs, suitable either for leaping or poking poles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major returns their salute with a lowering brow, for he strongly
      suspects they are there on their own account, and not for the sake of
      enjoying a day with his unrivalled hounds. However, as neither of them
      have leave over the ground, they can neither of them find fault, and must
      just put up with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Major, addressing Springer, says &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a shillin&rsquo; if
      you&rsquo;ll find me a hare,&rdquo; as he turns to the Bumbler and bids him uncouple
      Billy&rsquo;s old friends Ruffler and Bustler. This done, the hounds quickly
      spread to try and hit off the morning scent, while the myrtle-greeners and
      others distribute themselves, cracking, Hopping, and hissing, here, there,
      and everywhere. Springer and Pitfall go poke, poke, tap, tap, peep, peep,
      at every likely bush and tuft, but both the Major and they are too often
      over the ground to allow of hares being very plentiful. When they do find
      them they are generally well in wind from work. Meanwhile, Mr. Wotherspoon,
      finding that Billy Pringle is a friend of Lord Ladythorne&rsquo;s, makes up to
      him, and speaks of his lordship in the kind, encouraging way, so becoming
      a great man speaking of a lesser one. &ldquo;Oh, he knew his lordship well,
      excellent man he was, knew Mrs. Moffatt, too&mdash;&lsquo;andsome woman she was.
      Not so &lsquo;andsome, p&rsquo;raps, as Mrs. Spangles, the actress, but still a
      v-a-a-ry &lsquo;andsome woman. Ah, he knew Mrs. Spangles, poor thing, long
      before she came to Tantivy&mdash;when she was on the stage, in fact.&rdquo; And
      here the old buck, putting his massive, gold-mounted riding-whip under his
      arm, heaved a deep sigh, as though the mention of her name recalled
      painful recollections, and producing his gold snuff-box, after offering it
      to Billy, he consoled himself with a long-drawn respiration from its
      contents. He then flourished his scarlet, attar-of-rose-scented bandana,
      and seemed lost in contemplation of the stripes down his trowsers and his
      little lacquered-toe&rsquo;d boots. Billy rode silently on with him, making no
      doubt he was a very great man&mdash;just the sort of man his Mamma would
      wish him to get acquainted with.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV.<br/>THE WILD BEAST ITSELF.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>UST as the old
      buck was resuming the thread of his fashionable high-life narrative,
      preparatory to sounding Billy about the Major and his family, the same
      sort of electric thrill shot through the field that characterised the
      terrible &ldquo;g-n-r along&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see the hounds are running?&rdquo; de
      Glancey day with the Earl. Billy felt all over he-didn&rsquo;t-know-how-ish&mdash;very
      wish-he-was-at-home-ish. The horse, too, began to caper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thrill is caused by a shilling&rsquo;s-worth of wide-awake on a stick held
      high against the sky-line of the gently-swelling hill on the left,
      denoting that the wild beast is found, causing the Major to hold up his
      hat as a signal of reply, and all the rest of the field to desist from
      their flopping and thistle-whipping, and rein in their screws for the
      coming conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now s-s-sir!&rdquo; exclaims the stuttering Major, cantering up to our Billy
      all flurry and enthusiasm. &ldquo;Now, s-s-sir! we ha-ha-have her, and if you&rsquo;ll
      fo-fo-follow me, I&rsquo;ll show you her,&rdquo; thinking he was offering Billy the
      greatest treat imaginable. So saying the Major drops his hands on White
      Surrey&rsquo;s neck, rises in his stirrups, and scuttles away, bounding over the
      gorse bushes and broom that intervened between him and the still
      stick-hoisted tenpenny.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ****
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Where is she?</i>&rdquo; demands the Major. &ldquo;<i>Where is she!</i>&rsquo; repeats
      he, coming up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Major, he mun gi&rsquo; us halfe-croon ony ho&rsquo; this time,&rdquo; exclaims our
      friend Tom Springer, whose head gear it is that has been hoisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deed mun ye!&rdquo; asserts Pitfall, who has now joined his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No, no!</i>&rdquo; retorts the Major angrily, &ldquo;I said a shillin&rsquo;&mdash;a
      shillin&rsquo;s my price, and you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but consider what a time we&rsquo;ve been a lookin&rsquo; for her, Major,&rdquo;
       replied Springer, mopping his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but consider that you are about to partake of the enjoyments as
      well as myself, and that I find the whole of this expensive
      establishment,&rdquo; retorted the Major, looking back for his hounds. &ldquo;Not a
      farthin&rsquo; subscription.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say two shillin&rsquo;s, then,&rdquo; replied Springer coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the Major, &ldquo;a shillin&rsquo;s plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it eighteen-pence then,&rdquo; said Pitfall, &ldquo;and oop she goes for the
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come,&rdquo; snapped the Major hurriedly, as Billy now came elbowing up.
      &ldquo;Where is she? Where is she?&rdquo; demanded he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A, she&rsquo;s not here&mdash;she&rsquo;s not here, but I see her in her form
      thonder,&rdquo; replied Springer, nodding towards the adjoining bush-dotted
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to her, then,&rdquo; said the Major, jingling the eighteen-pence in his
      hand, to be ready to give him on view of the hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man then led the way through rushes, brambles, and briars, keeping a
      steady eye on the spot where she sate. At length he stopped. &ldquo;There she&rsquo;s,
      see!&rdquo; said he, <i>sotto voce</i>, pointing to the green hill-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have her!&rdquo; whispered the Major, his keen eyes sparkling with delight.
      &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; said he to Billy, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll show her to you. There,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;there you see that patch of gorse with the burnt stick stumps, at the low
      end&mdash;well, carry your eye down the slope of the land, past the old
      willow-tree, and you have her as plain as a pike-staff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy shook his head. He saw nothing but a tuft or two of rough grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, you see her large eyes watching us,&rdquo; continued the Major,
      &ldquo;thinking she sees us without our seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; our friend didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; laughed the Major, &ldquo;very odd,&rdquo; with the sort of vexation a man
      feels when another can&rsquo;t be made to see the object he does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give them a view now?&rdquo; asked Springer, &ldquo;or put her away
      quietly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, put her away quietly,&rdquo; replied the Major, &ldquo;put her away quietly; and
      let them get their noses well down to the scent;&rdquo; adding&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
      some strange hounds out, and I want to see how they work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man then advanced a few paces, and touching one of the apparently
      lifeless tufts with his pole, out sprang puss and went stotting and
      dotting away with one ear back and the other forward, in a state of
      indignant perturbation. &ldquo;Buck!&rdquo; exclaims Pitfall, watching her as she
      goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt it,&rdquo; replied the Major, scrutinising her attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay look at its head and shoulders; did you iver see sic red shoulders as
      those on a doe?&rdquo; asked Springer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s your money,&rdquo; handing Springer the
      eighteen-pence, &ldquo;and I hope she&rsquo;ll be worth it; but mind, for the futur&rsquo; a
      shillin&rsquo;s my price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After scudding up the hill, puss stopped to listen and ascertain the
      quality of her pursuers. She had suffered persecution from many hands,
      shooters, coursers, snarers, and once before from the Major and his
      harriers. That, however, was on a bad scenting day, and she had not had
      much difficulty in beating them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Solomon has been creeping quietly on with his hounds,
      encouraging such to hunt as seemed inclined that way, though the majority
      were pretty well aware of the grand discovery and lean towards the
      horsemen in advance. Puss however had slipped away unseen by the hounds,
      and Twister darts at the empty form thinking to save all trouble by a
      chop. Bracelet then strikes a scent in advance. Ruffler and Chaunter
      confirm it, and after one or two hesitating rashes and flourishes,
      increasing in intensity each time, a scent is fairly established, and away
      they drive full cry amid exclamations of &ldquo;Beautiful! beautiful! never saw
      anything puttier!&rdquo; from the Major and the field&mdash;the music of the
      hounds being increased and prolonged by the echoes of the valleys and
      adjacent hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The field then fall into line, Silent Solomon first, the Major of course
      next. Fine Billy third, with Wotherspoon and Nettlefold rather contending
      for his company. Nabley, Duffield, Bonnet, Reunison. Fanlder, Catcheside,
      truants, all mixed up together in heterogeneous confusion, jostling for
      precedence as men do when there are no leaps. So they round Hawthorn hill,
      and pour up the pretty valley beyond, each man riding a good deal harder
      than his horse, the hounds going best pace, which however is not very
      great.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me,&mdash;&rdquo; inwardly prays the Major, cantering consequentially
      along with his thong-gathered whip held up like a sword, &ldquo;give me five and
      twenty minutes, the first fifteen a burst, then a fault well hit off&rsquo;, and
      the remaining ten without a turn,&rdquo; thinking to astonish the supercilious
      foxhunter. Then he takes a sly look to see how Napoleon is faring, it
      being by no means his intention to let Fine Billy get to the bottom of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On, on, the hounds press, for now is the time to enjoy the scent with a
      hare, and they have run long enough together to have confidence in their
      leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Lovely has the scent, now Lilter, now Ruffler flings in advance, and
      again is superseded by Twister.
    </p>
    <p>
      They brush through the heathery open with an increasing cry, and fling at
      the cross-road between Birwell Mill and Capstone with something like the
      energy of foxhounds; Twister catches it up beyond the sandy track, and
      hurrying over it, some twenty yards further on is superseded by Lovely,
      who hits it off to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away she goes with the lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful! beautiful!&rdquo; exclaims the Major, hoping the fox-hunter sees it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful! beautiful!&rdquo; echoes Nettlefold, as the clustering pack drop
      their sterns to the scent and push forward with renewed velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major again looks for our friend Billy, who is riding in a very
      careless slack-rein sort of style, not at all adapted for making the most
      of his horse. However it is no time for remonstrance, and the music of the
      hounds helps to make things pleasant. On, on they speed; up one hill, down
      another, round a third, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      One great advantage of hunting in a strange country undoubtedly is, that
      all runs are straight, with harriers as well as foxhounds, with some men,
      who ride over the same ground again and again without knowing that it is
      the same, and Billy was one of this sort. Though they rounded Hawthorn
      hill again, it never occurred to him that it was the second time of
      asking; indeed he just cantered carelessly on like a man on a
      watering-place hack, thinking when his hour will be out, regardless of the
      beautiful hits made by Lovely and Lilter or any of them, and which almost
      threw the Major and their respective admirers into ecstacies. Great was
      the praise bestowed upon their performances, it being the interest of
      every man to magnify the run and astonish the stranger. Had they but known
      as much of the Richest Commoner as the reader does, they would not have
      given themselves the trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away they pour over hill and dale, over soft ground and sound, through
      reedy rushes and sedgy flats, and over the rolling stones of the fallen
      rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they score away full cry on getting upon more propitious ground. What
      a cry they make! and echo seemingly takes pleasure to repeat the sound!
    </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon the Great presently begins to play the castanets with his feet,
      an ominous sound to our Major, who looks back for the Bumbler, and
      inwardly wishes for a check to favour his design of dismounting our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a mile or so further on, and the chance occurs. They get upon a piece
      of bare heather burnt ground, whose peaty smell baffles the scent, and
      brings the hounds first to a check, then to a stand-still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon&rsquo;s hand in the air beckons a halt, to which the field gladly
      respond, for many of the steeds are eating new oats, and do not get any
      great quantity of those, while some are on swedes, and others only have
      hay. Altogether their condition is not to be spoken of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major now all hurry scurry, just like a case of &ldquo;second horses!
      second horses! where&rsquo;s my fellow with my second horse?&rdquo; at a check in
      Leicestershire, beckons the Bumbler up to Billy; and despite of our
      friend&rsquo;s remonstrance, who has got on such terms with Napoleon as to allow
      of his taking the liberty of spurring him, and would rather remain where
      he is, insists upon putting him upon the mare again, observing, that he
      couldn&rsquo;t think of taking the only spare &lsquo;orse from a gen&rsquo;lman who had done
      him the distinguished honour of leaving the Earl&rsquo;s establishment for his
      &lsquo;umble pack; and so, in the excitement of the moment, Billy is hustled off
      one horse and hurried on to another, as if a moment&rsquo;s hesitation would be
      fatal to the fray. The Major then, addressing the Bumbler in an undertone,
      says, &ldquo;Now walk that &lsquo;orse quietly home, and get him some linseed tea, and
      have him done up by the time we get in.&rdquo; He then spurs gallantly up to the
      front, as though he expected the hounds to be off again at score. There
      was no need of such energy, for puss has set them a puzzle that will take
      them some time to unravel; but it saved an argument with Billy, and
      perhaps the credit of the bay. He now goes drooping and slouching away,
      very unlike the cock-horse he came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the hounds have shot out and contracted, and shot out and
      contracted&mdash;and tried and tested, and tried and tested&mdash;every
      tuft and every inch of burnt ground, while Solomon sits motionless between
      them and the head mopping chattering field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be on,&rdquo; observes Caleb Rennison, the horse-breaker, whose
      three-year-old began fidgetting and neighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back, I say,&rdquo; speculated Bonnet, whose domicile lay to the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; observed Captain Nabley, &ldquo;they ran her well to here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hares are queer things,&rdquo; said old Duffield, wishing he had her by the
      ears for the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far more hunting with a hare nor a fox,&rdquo; observed Mr. Rintoul, who always
      praised his department of the chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must have squatted,&rdquo; observes old &ldquo;Wotherspoon, taking a pinch of snuff,
      and placing his double gold eye-glasses on his nose to reconnoitre the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lies very close, if she has,&rdquo; rejoins Godfrey Faulder, flopping at a
      furze-bush as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost her, I fear,&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Trail, who meant to beg her for a
      christening dinner if they killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, puss having, as we said before, had a game at romps with her
      pursuers on a bad scenting day, when she regulated her speed by their
      pace, has been inconveniently pressed on the present occasion, and feeling
      her strength fail, has had recourse to some of the many arts for which
      hares are famous. After crossing the burnt ground she made for a greasy
      sheep-track, up which she ran some fifty yards, and then deliberately
      retracing her steps, threw herself with a mighty spring into a rushy furze
      patch at the bottom of the hill. She now lies heaving and panting, and
      watching the success of her stratagem from her ambush, with the
      terror-striking pack full before her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.<br/>A CRUEL FINISH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>VERY hound having
      at length sniffed and snuffed, and sniffed and snuffed, to satiety,
      Solomon now essays to assist them by casting round the flat of
      smoke-infected ground. He makes the &lsquo;head good first, which manouvre
      hitting off the scent, he is hailed and applauded as a conqueror. Never
      was such a huntsman as Solomon! First harrier huntsman in England! Worth
      any money is a huntsman! The again clamorous pack bustle up the
      sheep-path, at such a pace as sends the leaders hurrying far beyond the
      scent. Then the rear rush to the front, and a general spread of
      bewildered, benighted, confusion ensues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where <i>has</i> she got to?&rdquo; is the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubled!&rdquo; mutters the disappointed Major, reining in his steed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squatted!&rdquo; exclaims Mr. Rintoul, who always sported an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold hard!&rdquo; cries Mr. Trail, though they were all at a standstill; but
      then he wished to let them know he was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leading hounds retrace their steps, and again essay to carry the scent
      forward. The second effort is attended with the same result as the first.
      They cannot get it beyond the double.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cunning animal!&rdquo; mutters the Major, eyeing their endeavours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far more hunt with a hare nor a fox,&rdquo; now observes Mr. Bonnet, raising
      his white hat to cool his bald head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far!&rdquo; replies Mr. Faulder, thinking he must be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for the red coats there wouldn&rsquo;t be so many fox-hunters,&rdquo;
       chuckles old Duffield, who dearly loves roast hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon is puzzled; but as he doesn&rsquo;t profess to be wiser than the hounds,
      he just lets them try to make it out for themselves. If they can&rsquo;t wind
      her, he can&rsquo;t: so the old sage sits like a statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the majority give her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Springer and Pitfall, and two or three other pedestrians who have
      been attracted from their work by the music of the hounds, and have been
      enjoying the panorama of the chase with their pipes from the summit of an
      inside hill, descend to see if they can either prick her or pole her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down go their heads as if they were looking for a pin.&mdash;The hounds,
      however, have obliterated all traces of her, and they soon have recourse
      to their staves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Bang, bang, bang</i>, they beat the gorse and broom and juniper bushes
      with vigorous sincerity. Crack, flop, crack, go the field in aid of their
      endeavours. Solomon leans with his hounds to the left, which is lucky for
      puss, for though she withstood the downward blow of Springer&rsquo;s pole on her
      bush, a well-directed side thrust sends her flying out in a state of the
      greatest excitement. What an outburst of joy the sight of her occasioned!
      Hounds, horses, riders, all seemed to participate in the common
      enthusiasm! How they whooped, and halloo&rsquo;d and shouted! enough to frighten
      the poor thing out of her wits. Billy and the field have a grand view of
      her, for she darts first to the right, then to the left, then off the
      right and again to the left, ere she tucks her long legs under her and
      strides up Kleeope hill at a pace that looks quite unapproachable. Faulder
      alone remains where he is, muttering &ldquo;fresh har&rdquo; as she goes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major and all the rest of the field hug their horses and tear along in
      a state of joyous excitement, for they see her life is theirs. They keep
      the low ground and jump with the hounds at the bridlegate between Greenlaw
      sheep-walks and Hindhope cairn just as Lovely hits the scent off over the
      boundary wall, and the rest of the pack endorse her note. They are now on
      fresh ground, which greatly aids the efforts of the hounds, who push on
      with a head that the Major thinks ought to procure them a compliment from
      Billy. Our friend, however, keeps all his compliments for the ladies, not
      being aware that there is anything remarkable in the performance, which he
      now begins to wish at an end. He has ridden as long as he likes, quite as
      much as Mr. Spavin, or any of the London livery stable-keepers, would let
      him have for half-a-guinea. Indeed he wishes he mayn&rsquo;t have got more than
      is good for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major meanwhile, all energy and enthusiasm, rides gallantly forward,
      for though he is no great hand among the enclosures, he makes a good fight
      in the hills, especially when, as now, he knows every yard of the country.
      Many&rsquo;s the towl he&rsquo;s had over it, though to look at his excited face one
      would think this was his first hunt. He&rsquo;ll now &ldquo;bet half-a-crown they kill
      her!&rdquo; He&rsquo;ll &ldquo;bet a guinea they kill her!&rdquo; He&rsquo;ll &ldquo;bet a fi-pun note they
      kill her!&rdquo; He&rsquo;ll &ldquo;bet half the national debt they kill her!&rdquo; as Dainty,
      and Lovely, and Bustler, after dwelling and hesitating over some rushy
      ground, at length proclaim the scent beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away they all sweep like the careering wind. On follow the field in
      glorious excitement. A flock of black-faced sheep next foil the ground&mdash;sheep
      as wild, if not wilder, than the animal the hounds are pursuing. We often
      think, when we see these strong-scented animals scouring the country, that
      a good beast of chase has been overlooked for the stag. Why shouldn&rsquo;t an
      old wiry black-faced tup, with his wild sparkling eyes and spiral horns,
      afford as good a run as a home-fed deer? Start the tup in his own rough
      region, and we will be bound to say he will give the hounds and their
      followers a scramble. The Major now denounces the flying flock&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      those nasty muttons!&rdquo; exclaims he, &ldquo;bags of bone rather, for they won&rsquo;t be
      meat these five years. Wonder how any sane people can cultivate such
      animals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hounds hunt well through the difficulty, or the Major would have been
      more savage still. On they go, yapping and towling, and howling as before,
      the Major&rsquo;s confidence in a kill increasing at every stride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terror-striking shouts that greeted poor puss&rsquo;s exit from the bush,
      have had the effect as well of driving her out of her country as of
      pressing her beyond her strength; and she has no sooner succeeded in
      placing what she hopes is a comfortable distance between herself and her
      pursuers, than she again has recourse to those tricks with which nature
      has so plentifully endowed her. Sinking the hill she makes for the little
      enclosed allotments below, and electing a bare fallow&mdash;bare, except
      in the matter of whicken grass&mdash;she steals quietly in, and commences
      her performances on the least verdant part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      First she described a small circle, then she sprung into the middle of it
      and squatted. Next she jumped up and bounded out in a different direction
      to the one by which she had entered. She then ran about twenty yards up a
      furrow, retracing her steps backwards, and giving a roll near where she
      started from. Then she took three bounding springs to the left, which
      landed her on the hard headland, and creeping along the side of the wall
      she finally popped through the water-hole, and squeezed into an incredibly
      small space between the kerbstone and the gate-post. There she lay with
      her head to the air, panting and heaving, and listening for her dread
      pursuers coming. O what agony was hers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the gallant band came howling and towling over the hill, in all
      the gay delirium of a hunt without leaps&mdash;the Major with difficulty
      restraining their ardour as he pointed out the brilliance of the
      performance to Billy&mdash;&ldquo;Most splendid running! most capital hunting!
      most superb pack!&rdquo; with a sly &ldquo;<i>pish</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>shaw</i>&rdquo; at foxhounds
      in general, and Sir Mosey&rsquo;s in particular. The Major hadn&rsquo;t got over the
      Bo-peep business, and never would.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pack now reached the scene of Puss&rsquo;s frolics, and the music very soon
      descended from a towering tenour to an insignificant whimper, which at
      length died out altogether. Soloman and Bulldog were again fixtures,
      Solomon as usual with his hand up beckoning silence. He knew how weak the
      scent must be, and how important it was to keep quiet at such a critical
      period; and let the hounds hit her off if they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puss had certainly given them a Gordian knot to unravel, and not all the
      hallooing and encouragement in the world could drive them much beyond the
      magic circle she had described. Whenever the hunt seemed likely to be
      re-established, it invariably resulted in a return to the place from
      whence they started. They couldn&rsquo;t get forward with it at all, and poked
      about, and tested the same ground over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a regular period or full stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very rum,&rdquo; observed Caleb Rennison, looking first at his three-year-old,
      then at his watch, thinking that it was about pudding-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s surely a witch,&rdquo; said Mr. Wotherspoon, taking a prolonged pinch of
      snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll roast her for one at all events,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Trail, the
      auctioneer, still hoping to get her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First catch your hare, says Mrs. Somebody,&rdquo; responded Captain Nabley,
      eyeing the sorely puzzled pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O ketch her! we&rsquo;re sure to ketch her,&rdquo; observed Mr. Nettlefold, chucking
      up his chin and dismounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so clear about that,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Rintoul, as Lovely, and Bustler,
      and Lilter, again returned to repeat the search.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If those hounds can&rsquo;t own her, there are no hounds in England can,&rdquo;
       asserted the Major, anxious to save the credit of his pack before the&mdash;he
      feared&mdash;too critical stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this depressing moment, again come the infantry, and commence the same
      system of peering and poking that marked their descent on the former
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now poor puss being again a little recruited, steals out of her
      hiding-place, and crosses quietly along the outside of the wall to where a
      flock of those best friends to a hunted hare, some newly-smeared,
      white-faced sheep, were quietly nibbling at the halfgrass, half-heather,
      of the little moor-edge farm of Mossheugh-law, whose stone-roofed
      buildings, washed by a clear mountain stream, and sheltered by a clump of
      venerable Scotch firs, stand on a bright green patch, a sort of oasis in
      the desert. The sheep hardly deign to notice the hare, far different to
      the consternation bold Reynard carries into their camp, when they go
      circling round like a squadron of dragoons, drawing boldly up to charge
      when the danger&rsquo;s past. So poor, weary, foot sore, fur-matted puss, goes
      hobbling and limping up to the farm-buildings as if to seek protection
      from man against his brother man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it so happened that Mrs. Kidwell, the half-farmer, half-shepherd&rsquo;s
      pretty wife, was in the fold-yard, washing her churn, along with her
      little chubby-faced Jessey, who was equally busy with her Mamma munching
      away at a very long slice of plentifully-buttered and sugar&rsquo;d bread; and
      Mamma chancing to look up from the churn to see how her darling
      progressed, saw puss halting at the threshold, as if waiting to be asked
      in.
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that mad old Major and his dogs!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Kidwell, catching
      up the child lest its red petticoat might scare away the visitor, and
      popping into the dairy, she saw the hare, after a little demur, hobble
      into the cow-house. Having seen her well in, Mrs. Kidwell emerged from her
      hiding-place, and locking the door, she put the key in her pocket, and
      resumed her occupation with her churn. Presently the familiar melody&mdash;the
      yow, yow, yap, yap, yow, yow of the hounds broke upon her ear, increasing
      in strength as she listened, making her feel glad she was at hand to
      befriend the poor hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunt was indeed revived. The hounds, one and all, having declared
      their inability to make any thing more of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon had set off on one of his cruises, which resulted in the yeomen
      prickers and he meeting at the gate, where the hare had squatted, when
      Lovely gave tongue, just as Springer, with his eyes well down, exclaimed,
      &ldquo;<i>here she&rsquo;s!</i>&rdquo; Bustler, and Bracelet, and Twister, and Chaunter,
      confirmed Lovely&rsquo;s opinion, and away they went with the feeble scent
      peculiar to the sinking animal. Their difficulties are further increased
      by the sheep, it requiring Solomon&rsquo;s oft-raised hand to prevent the hounds
      being hurried over the line&mdash;as it is, the hunt was conducted on the
      silent system for some little distance. The pace rather improved after
      they got clear of the smear and foil of the muttons, and the Major pulled
      up his gills, felt his tie, and cocked his hat jauntily, as the hounds
      pointed for the pretty farm-house, the Major thinking to show off to
      advantage before Mrs. Kidwell. They presently carried the scent up to the
      still open gates of the fold-yard. Lovely now proclaims where puss has
      paused. Things look very critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good mornin&rsquo;, Mrs. Kidwell,&rdquo; exclaimed the gallant Major, addressing her;
      &ldquo;pray how long have you been at the churn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, this twenty minutes or more, Major,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Kidwell, gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got the hare in it, have you?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of; but you can look if you like,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Kidwell,
      colouring slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no; we&rsquo;ll take your word for it,&rdquo; rejoined the Major gallantly.
      &ldquo;Must be on, Solomon; must be on,&rdquo; said he&mdash;nodding his huntsman to
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solomon is doubtful, but &ldquo;master being master,&rdquo; Solomon holds his hounds
      on past the stable, round the lambing-sheds and stackyard, to the front of
      the little three windows and a doored farm-house, without eliciting a
      whimper, no, not even from a babbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment a passing cloud discharged a gentle shower over the
      scene, and when Solomon returned to pursue his inquiries in the fold-yard,
      the last vestige of scent had been effectually obliterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kidwell now stood watching the inquisitive proceedings if the party,
      searching now the hen-house, now the pigstye, now the ash-hole; and when
      Solomon tried the cow-house door, she observed carelessly: &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s
      locked;&rdquo; and he passed on to examine the straw-shed adjoining. All places
      were overhauled and scrutinized. At length, even Captain Nabley&rsquo;s
      detective genius failed in suggesting where puss could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you see her last?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Kidwell, with well-feigned
      ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;ve not seen her for some time; but the hounds hunted her up to
      your very gate,&rdquo; replied the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deary me, how strange! and you&rsquo;ve made nothin&rsquo; of her since?&rdquo; observed
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; assented the Major, reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; observed Mr. Catcheside, who was anxious for a kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw nothin&rsquo; like it,&rdquo; asserted Mr. Rintoul, looking again into the
      pigstye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have doubled back,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Nettlefold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should have met her if she had,&rdquo; observed old Duffield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must be somewhere hereabouts,&rdquo; observes Mr. Trail, dismounting, and
      stamping about on foot among the half-trodden straw of the fold-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      No puss there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard upon the hounds,&rdquo; observes Mr. Wotherspoon, replenishing his nose
      with a good charge of snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Cruel</i>, indeed,&rdquo; assented the Major, who never gave them more than
      entrails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw a hare better hunted!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Nabley, lighting a
      cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; assented fat Mr. Nettleford, mopping his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long was it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Rintoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour and five minutes,&rdquo; replied the Major, looking at his watch
      (five-and-forty minutes in reality).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;V-a-a-ry good running,&rdquo; elaborates old dandy Wortherspoon. &ldquo;I see by the
      <i>Post</i>, that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose we must give her up,&rdquo; interrupted the Major, who didn&rsquo;t
      want to have the contents of his own second-hand copy forestalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity to leave her,&rdquo; observes Mr. Trail, returning to his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you do?&rdquo; asked the Major, adding, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use sitting here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; assents Captain Nabley, blowing a cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a nod from the Major, Solomon now collects his hounds, and passing
      through the scattered group, observes with a sort of Wellingtonian touch
      of his cap, in reply to their condolence, &ldquo;Yes, sir, but it takes a <i>slee</i>
      chap, sir, to kill a moor-edge hare, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the poor Major was foiled of his fur, and when the cows came lowing
      down from the fell to be milked, kind Mrs. Kidwell opened the door and out
      popped puss, as fresh and lively as ever; making for her old haunts, where
      she was again to be found at the end of a week.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.<br/>THE PRINGLE CORRESPONDENCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE reader will
      perhaps wonder what our fair friend Mrs. Pringle is about, and how there
      happens to be no tidings from Curtain Crescent. Tidings there were, only
      the Tantivy Castle servants were so oppressed with work that they could
      never find time to redirect her effusions. At length Mr. Beverage, the
      butler, seeing the accumulation of letters in Mr. Packwood, the
      house-steward&rsquo;s room, suggested that they might perhaps be wanted,
      whereupon Mr. Packwood huddled them into a fresh envelope, and sent them
      to the post along with the general consignment from the Castle. Very
      pressing and urgent the letters were, increasing in anxiety with each one,
      as no answer had been received to its predecessor. Were it not that Mrs.
      Pringle knew the Earl would have written, she would have feared her Billy
      had sustained some hunting calamity. The first letter merely related how
      Mrs. Pringle had gone to uncle Jerry&rsquo;s according to appointment to have a
      field-day among the papers, and how Jerry had gone to attend an
      anti-Sunday-band meeting, leaving seed-cake, and sponge-cake, and wine,
      with a very affectionate three-cornered note, saying how deeply he
      deplored the necessity, but how he hoped to remedy the delay by another
      and an early appointment. This letter enclosed a very handsome large
      coat-of-arms seal, made entirely out of Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s own head&mdash;containing
      what the heralds call assumptive arms&mdash;divided into as many
      compartments as a backgammon board, which she advised Billy to use
      judiciously, hinting that Major H. (meaning our friend Major Y.) would be
      a fitter person to try it upon than Lord L. The next letter, among many
      other things of minor importance, reminded Billy that he had not told his
      Mamma what Mrs. Moffatt had on, or whether they had any new dishes for
      dinner, and urging him to write her full particulars, but to be careful
      not to leave either his or her letters lying about, and hoping that he
      emptied his pockets every night instead of leaving that for Rougier to do,
      and giving him much other good and wholesome advice. The third letter was
      merely to remind him that she had not heard from him in answer to either
      of her other two, and begging him just to drop her a single line by return
      of post, saying he was well, and so on. The next was larger, enclosing him
      a double-crest seal, containing a lion on a cap of dignity, and an eagle,
      for sealing notes in aid of the great seal, and saying that she had had a
      letter from uncle Jerry, upbraiding her for not keeping her appointment
      with him, whereas she had never made any, he having promised to make one
      with her, and again urging Billy to write to her, if only a single line,
      and when he had time to send her a full account of what Mrs. Moffatt had
      on every day, and whether they had any new dishes for dinner, and all the
      news, sporting and otherwise, urging him as before to take care of Dowb
      (meaning himself), and hoping he was improving in his hunting, able to sit
      at the jumps, and enjoying himself generally..
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifth, which caused the rest to come, was a mere repetition of her
      anxieties and requests for a line, and immediately produced the following
      letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      MR. WILLIAM TO HIS MAMMA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yammerton Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest Mamma,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your letters have all reached me at once, for though both Rougier and I
      especially charged the butler and another fine fellow, and gave them heads
      to put on, to send all that came immediately, they seem to have waited for
      an accumulation so as to make one sending do. It is very idle of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The seals are beautiful, and I am very much obliged to you for them. I
      will seal this letter with the large one by way of a beginning. It seems
      to be uncommonly well quartered&mdash;quite noble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will now tell you all my movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been here at Major Yammerton&rsquo;s,&mdash;not Hammerton&rsquo;s as you
      called him&mdash;for some days enjoying myself amazingly, for the Major
      has a nice pack of harriers that go along leisurely, instead of tearing
      away at the unconscionable pace the Earl&rsquo;s do. Still, a canter in the Park
      at high tide in my opinion is a much better thing with plenty of ladies
      looking on. Talking of cantering reminds me I&rsquo;ve bought a horse of the
      Major&rsquo;s,&mdash;bought him all except paying for him, so you had better
      send me the money, one hundred guineas; for though the Major says I may
      pay for him when I like, and seems quite easy about it, they say horses
      are always ready money, so I suppose I must conform to the rule. It is a
      beautiful bay with four black legs, and a splendid mane and tail&mdash;very
      blood-like and racing; indeed the Major says if I was to put him into some
      of the spring handicaps I should be sure to win a hatful of money with
      him, or perhaps a gold cup or two. The Major is a great sportsman and has
      kept hounds for a great number of years, and altogether he is very
      agreeable, and I feel more at home here than I did at the Castle, where,
      though everything was very fine, still there was no fun and only Mrs.
      Moffatt to talk to, at least in the lady way, for though she always
      professed to be expecting lady callers, none ever came that I saw or heard
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really forget all about the dinners there, except that they were very
      good and lasted a long time. We had a new dish here the other night, which
      if you want a novelty, you can introduce, namely, to flavour the plates
      with castor oil; you will find it a very serviceable one for saving your
      meat, as nobody can eat it. Mrs. Moffatt was splendidly dressed every day,
      sometimes in blue, sometimes in pink, sometimes in green, sometimes in
      silk, sometimes in satin, sometimes in velvet with a profusion of very
      lovely lace and magnificent jewelry. Rougier says, &lsquo;she makes de hay vile
      the son does shine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how long I shall stay here, certainly over Friday, and most
      likely until Monday, after which I suppose I shall go back to the Castle.
      The Major says I must have another day with his hounds, and I don&rsquo;t care
      if I do, provided he keeps in the hills and away from the jumps, as I can
      manage the galloping well enough. It&rsquo;s the jerks that send me out of my
      saddle. A hare is quite a different animal to pursue to a fox, and seems
      to have some sort of consideration for its followers. She stops short
      every now and then and jumps up in view, instead of tearing away like an
      express train on a railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girls here are very pretty&mdash;Miss Yammerton extremely so,&mdash;fair,
      with beautiful blue eyes, and such a figure; but Rougier says they are
      desperately bad-tempered, except the youngest one, who is dark and like
      her Mamma; but I shouldn&rsquo;t say Monsieur is a particular sweet-tempered
      gentleman himself. He is always grumbling and grouting about what he calls
      his &lsquo;grob&rsquo; and declares the Major keeps his house on sturdied mutton and
      stale beer. But he complained at the Castle that there was nothing but
      port and sherry, and composite candles to go to bed with, which he
      declared was an insult to his station, which entitles him to wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, think how funny and small this place looked after the Castle.
      It seemed just as if I had got into a series of closets instead of rooms.
      However, I soon got used to it, and like it amazingly. But here comes
      Monsieur with my dressing things, so I must out with the great seal and
      bid you good bye for the present, for the Major is a six o&rsquo;clock man, and
      doesn&rsquo;t like to be kept waiting for his dinner, so now, my dearest Mamma,
      believe me to remain ever your most truly affectionate son,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wm. Pringle,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To which we need scarcely say the delighted Mrs. Pringle replied by return
      of post, writing in the following loving and judicious strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;25, Curtain Crescent,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belgrave Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own Beloved Darling,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so overjoyed you can&rsquo;t imagine, to receive your most welcome
      letter, for I really began to be uneasy about you, not that I feared any
      accident out hunting, but I was afraid you might have caught cold or be
      otherwise unwell&mdash;mind, if ever you feel in the slightest degree
      indisposed send for the doctor immediately. There is nothing like taking
      things in time. It was very idle of the servants at Tantivy Castle to
      neglect your instructions so, but for the future you had better always
      write a line to the post-master of the place where you are staying, giving
      him your next address to forward your letters to; for it is the work for
      which they are paid, and there is no shuffling it off on to anybody else&rsquo;s
      shoulders. The greatest people are oftentimes the worst served, not
      because the servants have any particular objection to them personally&mdash;but
      because they are so desperately afraid of being what they call put upon by
      each other, that they spend double the time in fighting off doing a thing
      that it would take to do it. This is one of the drawbacks upon rank.
      Noblemen must keep a great staff of people, whom in a general way they
      cannot employ, and who do nothing but squabble and fight with each other
      who is to do the little there is, the greatest man among servants being he
      who does the least. However, as you have got the letters at last we will
      say no more about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope your horse is handsome, and neighs and paws the ground prettily;
      you should be careful, however, in buying, for few people are magnanimous
      enough to resist cheating a young man in horses;&mdash;still, I am glad
      you have bought one if he suits you, as it is much better and pleasanter
      to ride your own horse than be indebted to other people for mounts.
      Nevertheless, I would strongly advise you to stick to either the fox or
      the stag, with either of which you can sport pink and look smart. Harriers
      are only for bottle-nosed old gentlemen with gouty shoes. I can&rsquo;t help
      thinking, that a day with a milder, more reasonable fox than the ones you
      had with Lord Ladythorne, would convince you of the superiority of
      fox-hounds over harriers. I was asking Mr. Ralph Rasper, who called here
      the other day, how little Tom Stott of the Albany managed with the
      Queen&rsquo;s, and he said Tom always shoes his horses with country nails, and
      consequently throws a shoe before he has gone three fields, which enables
      him to pull up and lament his ill luck. He then gets it put on, and has a
      glorious ride home in red&mdash;landing at the Piccadilly end of the
      Albany about dusk. He then goes down to the Acacia or some other Club, and
      having ordered his dinner, retires to one of the dressing-rooms to change&mdash;having
      had, to his mind, a delightful day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware of the girls!&mdash;There&rsquo;s nothing so dangerous as a young man
      staying in a country house with pretty girls. He is sure to fall in love
      with one or other of them imperceptibly, or one or other of them is sure
      to fall in love with him; and then when at length he leaves, there is sure
      to be a little scene arranged, Miss with her red eye-lids and lace fringed
      kerchief, Mamma with her smirks and smiles, and hopes that he&rsquo;ll <i>soon
      return,</i> and so on. There are more matches made up in country houses
      than in all the west-end London ones put together,&mdash;indeed, London is
      always allowed to be only the cover for finding the game in, and the
      country the place for running it down. Just as you find your fox in a wood
      and run him down in the open. Be careful therefore what you are about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is much easier to get entangled with a girl than to get free again,
      for though they will always offer to set a young man free, they know
      better than do it, unless, indeed, they have secured something better,&mdash;above
      all, never consult a male friend in these matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stupidest woman that ever was born, is better than the cleverest man
      in love-affairs. In fact, no man is a match for a woman until he&rsquo;s
      married,&mdash;not all even then. The worst of young men is, they never
      know their worth until it is too late&mdash;they think the girls are
      difficult to catch, whereas there is nothing so easy, unless, as I said
      before, the girls are better engaged. Indeed, a young man should always
      have his Mamma at his elbow, to guard him against the machinations of the
      fair. As, however, that cannot be, let me urge you to be cautious what you
      are about, and as you seem to have plenty of choice, Don&rsquo;t be more
      attentive to one sister than to another, by which means you will escape
      the red eye-lids, and also escape having Mamma declaring you have trifled
      with Maria or Sophia&rsquo;s feelings, and all the old women of the
      neighbourhood denouncing your conduct and making up to you themselves for
      one of their own girls. Some ladies ask a man&rsquo;s intentions before he is
      well aware that he has any himself, but these are the spoil-sport order of
      women. Most of them are prudent enough to get a man well hooked before
      they hand him over to Papa. It is generally a case of &lsquo;Ask Mamma&rsquo; first.
      Beware of brothers!&mdash;I have known undoubted heiresses crumpled up
      into nothing by the appearance (after the catch) of two or three great
      heavy dragooners. Rougier will find all that out for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be cautious too about letter-writing. There is no real privacy about
      love-letters, any more than there is about the flags and banners of a
      regiment, though they occasionally furl and cover them up. The love
      letters are a woman&rsquo;s flags and banners, her trophies of success, and the
      more flowery they are, the more likely to be shown, and to aid in
      enlivening a Christmas tea-party. Then the girls&rsquo; Mammas read them, their
      sisters read them, their maids read them, and ultimately, perhaps, a
      boisterous energetic barrister reads them to an exasperated jury, some of
      whose daughters may have suffered from simitar effusions themselves.
      Altogether, I assure you, you are on very ticklish ground, and I make no
      doubt if you could ascertain the opinion of the neighbourhood, you are
      booked for one or other of the girls, so again I say, my dearest boy,
      beware what you are about, for it is much easier to get fast than to get
      free again;&mdash;get a lady of rank, and not the daughter of a little
      scrubby squire; and whatever you do, don&rsquo;t leave this letter lying about,
      and mind, empty your pockets at nights, and don&rsquo;t leave it for Rougier to
      find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, about your movements. I think I wouldn&rsquo;t go back to Lord L.&lsquo;s unless
      he asks you, or unless he named a specific day for your doing so when you
      came away. Mere general invitations mean nothing; they are only the small
      coin of good society. &lsquo;Sorry you&rsquo;re going. Hope we shall soon meet again.
      Hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you to dinner some day,&rsquo; is a
      very common mean-nothing form of politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I question that your going to a master of harriers from Tantivy
      Castle would be any great recommendation to his Lordship; for masters of
      foxhounds and masters of harriers are generally at variance. Altogether, I
      think I would pause and consider before you decided on returning. I would
      not talk much about his Lordship where you now are, as it would look as if
      you were not accustomed to great people. You&rsquo;ll find plenty of friends
      ready to bring him in for you, just as Mr. Handycock brings in Lord
      Privilege in Peter Simple. We all like talking of titles. Remember, all
      noblemen under the rank of dukes are lords in common conversation. No
      earls or marquises then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It just occurs to me, that as you are in the neighbourhood, you might
      take advantage of the opportunity for paying a visit to Yawnington Hot
      Wells, where you will find a great deal of good society assembled at this
      time of year, and where you might pickup some useful and desirable
      acquaintances. Go to the best hotel whatever it is, and put Rougier on
      board wages, which will get rid of his grumbling. It is impertinent, no
      doubt, but still it carries weight in a certain quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you have got a hunting horse, you will want a groom, and should try to
      get a nice-looking one. He should not be knocknee&rsquo;d; on the contrary,
      bow-legged,&mdash;the sort of legs that a pig can pop through. Look an
      applicant over first, and if his appearance is against him. just put him
      off quietly by taking his name and address, and say that there are one or
      two before him, and that you will write to him if you are likely to
      require his services.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will soon have plenty to choose from, but it is hard to say whether
      the tricks of the town ones, or the gaucheries of the country ones are
      most objectionable. The latter never put on their boots and upper things
      properly. A slangy, slovenly-looking fellow should be especially avoided.
      Also men with great shock heads of hair. If they can&rsquo;t trim themselves,
      there will not be much chance of their trimming their horses. In short, I
      believe a groom&mdash;a man who really knows and cares anything about
      horses&mdash;is a very difficult person to get. There are plenty who can
      hiss and fuss, and be busy upon nothing, but very few who can both dress a
      horse, and dress themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Lord Ladythorne makes it a rule never to take one who has been
      brought up in the racing-stable, for he says they are all hurry and
      gallop, and for putting two hours&rsquo; exercise into one. Whatever you do,
      don&rsquo;t take one without a character, for however people may gloss over
      their late servant&rsquo;s faults and imperfections, and however abject and
      penitent the applicants may appear, rely upon it, nature will out, and as
      soon as ever they get up their condition, as they call it, or are
      installed into their new clothes, they begin to take liberties, and
      ultimately relapse into their old drunken dissolute habits. It is
      fortunate for the world that most of them carry their characters in their
      faces. Besides, it isn&rsquo;t fair to respectable servants to bring them in
      contact with these sort of profligates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t let him find his own clothes. There isn&rsquo;t one in
      twenty who can be trusted to do so, and nothing looks worse than the
      half-livery, half-plain, wholly shabby clothes some of them adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wonderful what things they will vote good if they have to find
      others themselves, things that they would declare were not fit to put on,
      and they couldn&rsquo;t be seen in if master supplied them. The best of
      everything then is only good enough for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of them will grumble and growl whatever you give them; declare this
      man&rsquo;s cloth is bad, and another&rsquo;s boots inferior, and recommend you to go
      to Mr. Somebody else, who Mr. This, or Captain That, employs, Mr. This, or
      Captain That, having, in all probability, been recommended to this Mr.
      Somebody by some other servant. The same with the saddlers and
      tradespeople generally. If you employ a saddler who does not tip them,
      there will be nothing bad enough for his workmanship, or they will declare
      he does not do that sort of work, only farmer&rsquo;s work&mdash;cart-trappings,
      and such like things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The remedy for this is to pay your own bills, and give the servants to
      understand at starting that you mean to be master. They are to be had on
      your own terms, if you only begin as you mean to go on. If the worst comes
      to the worst, a month&rsquo;s notice, or a month&rsquo;s pay, settles all differences,
      and it is no use keeping and paying a servant that doesn&rsquo;t suit you.
      Perhaps you will think Rougier trouble enough, but he would be highly
      offended if you were to ask him to valet a horse. I will try if I can hear
      of anything likely to suit you, but the old saying, &lsquo;who shall counsel a
      man in the choice of a wife, or a horse,&rsquo; applies with equal force to
      grooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my own dearest boy, having given you all the advice and
      assistance in my power, I will conclude by repeating what joy the arrival
      of your letter occasioned me, and also my advice to beware of the girls,
      and request that you will not leave this letter in your pockets, or lying
      about, by signing myself ever, my own dearest son, your most truly loving
      and affectionate Mamma,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emma Pringle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>P.S.&mdash;I will enclose the halves of two fifty-pound notes for the
      horse, the receipt of which please to acknowledge by return of post, when
      I will send the other halves.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;Mind the red eyelids! There&rsquo;s nothing so infectious

      CHAPTER XXVII.<br/>SIR MOSES MAINCHANCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>UR friend Billy,
      as the foregoing letter shows, was now very comfortably installed in his
      quarters, and his presence brought sundry visitors, as well to pay their
      respects to him and the family, as to see how matters were progressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Rocket Larkspur, Mrs. Blurkins, and Mrs. Dotherington, also
      Mrs. Crickleton came after their castor-oil entertainment, and Mrs. and
      Miss Wasperton, accompanied by their stiff friend Miss Freezer, who had
      the reputation of being very satirical. Then there were Mr. Tight and Miss
      Neate, chaperoned by fat Mrs. Plumberry, of Hollingdale Lodge, and several
      others. In fact Billy had created a sensation in the country, such
      godsends as a London dandy not being of every-day occurrence in the
      country, and everybody wanted to see the great &ldquo;catch.&rdquo; How they magnified
      him! His own mother wouldn&rsquo;t have known him under the garbs he assumed;
      now a Lord&rsquo;s son, now a Baronet&rsquo;s, now the Richest Commoner in England;
      with, oh glorious recommendation! no Papa to consult in the matter of a
      wife. Some said not even a Mamma, but there the reader knows they were
      wrong. In proportion as they lauded Billy they decried Mrs. Yammerton; she
      was a nasty, cunning, designing woman, always looking after somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wasperton, alluding to Billy&rsquo;s age, declared that it was just like
      kidnapping a child, and she inwardly congratulated herself that she had
      never been guilty of such meanness. Billy, on his part, was airified and
      gay, showing off to the greatest advantage, perfectly unconscious that he
      was the observed of all observers. Like Mrs. Moffatt he never had the same
      dress on twice, and was splendid in his jewelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the carriage company who came to greet him was the sporting Baronet,
      Sir Moses Mainchance, whose existence we have already indicated, being the
      same generous gentleman that presented Major Yammerton with a horse, and
      then made him pay for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses had heard of Billy&rsquo;s opulence, and being a man of great
      versatility, he saw no reason why he should not endeavour to partake of
      it. He now came grinding up in his dog cart, with his tawdry cockaded
      groom (for he was a Deputy-Lieutenant of Hit-im and Holt-im shire), to lay
      the foundation of an invitation, and was received with the usual <i>wow,
      wow, wow, wow</i>, of Fury, the terrier, and the coat shuffling of the
      Bumbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the late handsome Recorder of London had to present this ugly old file
      to the Judges as one of the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, he would
      most likely introduce him in such terms as the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lords, I have the honour to present to your Lordships&rsquo; (hem) notice
      Sir Moses Mainchance, (cough) Baronet, and (hem) foxhunter, who has been
      unanimously chosen by the (hem) livery of London to fill the high and
      important (cough) office of Sheriff of that ancient and opulent city. My
      Lords, Sir Moses, as his name indicates, is of Jewish origin. His
      great-grandfather, Mr. Moses Levy, I believe dealt in complicated
      penknives, dog-collars, and street sponges. His grandfather, more
      ambitious, enlarged his sphere of action, and embarked in the old-clothes
      line. He had a very extensive shop in the Minories, and dealt in rhubarb
      and gum arabic as well. He married a lady of the name of Smith, not an
      uncommon one in this country, who inheriting a large fortune from her
      uncle, Mr. Mainchance, Mr. Moses Levy embraced Christianity, and dropping
      the name of Levy became Mr. Mainchance, Mr. Moses Mainchance, the founder
      of the present most important and distinguished family. His son, the
      Sheriff elect&rsquo;s father, also carried on the business in the Minories,
      adding very largely to his already abundant wealth, and espousing a lady
      of the name of Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In addition to the hereditary trade he opened a curiosity shop in the
      west end of London, where, being of a highly benevolent disposition, he
      accommodated young gentlemen whose parents were penurious,&mdash;unjustly
      penurious of course,&mdash;with such sums of money as their stations in
      life seemed likely to enable them to repay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my Lords, the usury laws, as your Lordships will doubtless
      recollect, being then in full operation, to the great detriment of
      heirs-at-law, Mr. Mainchance, feeling for the difficulties of the young,
      introduced an ingenious mode of evading them, whereby <i>some</i> article
      of <i>vertu</i>&mdash;generally a picture or something of that sort&mdash;was
      taken as half, or perhaps three-quarters of the loan, and having passed
      into the hands of the borrower was again returned to Mr. Mainchance at its
      real worth, a Carlo Dolce, or a Coal Pit, as your Lordships doubtless
      know, being capable of representing any given sum of money. This
      gentleman, my Lords, the Sheriff elect&rsquo;s father, having at length paid the
      debt of nature&mdash;the only debt I believe that he was ever slow in
      discharging&mdash;the opulent gentleman who now stands at my side, and
      whom I have the honour of presenting to the Court, was enabled through one
      of those monetary transactions to claim the services of a distinguished
      politician now no more, and obtain that hereditary rank which he so
      greatly adorns. On becoming a baronet Sir Moses Mainchance withdrew from
      commercial pursuits, and set up for a gentleman, purchasing the
      magnificent estate of Pangburn Park, in Hit-im and Hold-im shire, of which
      county he is a Deputy-Lieutenant, getting together an unrivalled pack of
      foxhounds&mdash;second to none as I am instructed&mdash;and hunting the
      country with great circumspection; and he requests me to add, he will be
      most proud and happy to see your Lordships to take a day with his hounds
      whenever it suits you, and also to dine with him this evening in the
      splendid Guildhall of the ancient and renowned City of London.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing outline, coupled with Sir Moses&rsquo; treatment of the Major,
      will give the reader some idea of the character of the gentleman who had
      sought the society of our hero. In truth, if nature had not made him the
      meanest, Sir Moses would have been the most liberal of mankind, for his
      life was a continual struggle between the magnificence of his offers and
      the penury of his performances. He was perpetually forcing favours upon
      people, and then backing out when he saw they were going to be accepted.
      It required no little face to encounter the victim of such a recent &ldquo;do&rdquo;
       as the Major&rsquo;s, but Sir Moses was not to be foiled when he had an object
      in view. Telling his groom to stay at the door, and asking in a stentorian
      voice if Mr. Pringle is at home, so that there may be no mistake as to
      whom he is calling upon, the Baronet is now ushered into the drawing-room,
      where the dandified Billy sits in all the dangerous proximity of three
      pretty girls without their Mamma. Mrs. Yammerton knew when to be out.
      &ldquo;Good morning, young ladies!&rdquo; exclaims Sir Moses gaily, greeting them all
      round&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Pringle,&rdquo; continued he, turning to Billy, &ldquo;allow me to
      introduce myself&mdash;I believe I have the pleasure of addressing a
      nephew of my excellent old friend Sir Jonathan Pringle, and I shall be
      most happy if I can contribute in any way to your amusement while in this
      neighbourhood. Tell me now,&rdquo; continued he, without waiting for Billy&rsquo;s
      admission or rejection of kindred with Sir Jonathan, &ldquo;tell me now, when
      you are not engaged in this delightful way,&rdquo; smiling round on the
      beauties, &ldquo;would you like to come and have a day with my hounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy shuddered at the very thought, but quickly recovering his
      equanimity, he replied, &ldquo;Yarse, he should like it very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s a mighty hunter!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Yammerton, who really
      thought he was.&mdash;&ldquo;Very good!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, &ldquo;very good! Then
      I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do. We meet on Monday at the Crooked Billet on
      the Bushmead Road&mdash;Tuesday at Stubbington Hill&mdash;Thursday,
      Woolerton, by Heckfield&mdash;Saturday, the Kennels. S&rsquo;pose now you come
      to me on Sunday, I would have said Saturday, only I&rsquo;m engaged to dine with
      Lord Oilcake, but you wouldn&rsquo;t mind coming over on a Sunday, I dare say,
      would you?&rdquo; and without waiting for an answer he went on to say, &ldquo;Come on
      Sunday, I&rsquo;ll send my dogcart for you, the thing I have at the door, we&rsquo;ll
      then hunt Monday and Tuesday, dine at the Club at Hinton on Wednesday,
      where we always have a capital dinner, and a party of excellent fellows,
      good singing and all sorts of fun, and take Thursday at Woolerton, in your
      way home&mdash;draw Shawley Moss, the Withy beds at Langton, Tangleton
      Brake, and so on, but sure to find before we get to the Brake, for there
      were swarms of foxes on the moss the last time we were there, and capital
      good ones they are. Dom&rsquo;d if they aren&rsquo;t. So know I think you couldn&rsquo;t be
      better Thursday, and I&rsquo;ll have a two-stalled stable ready for you on
      Sunday, so that&rsquo;s a bargain&mdash;ay, young ladies, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; appealing
      to our fair friends. And now fine Billy, who had been anxiously waiting to
      get a word in sideways while all this dread enjoyment was paraded,
      proceeded to make a vigorous effort to deliver himself from it. He was
      very much obliged to this unknown friend of his unknown uncle, Sir
      Jonathan, but he had only one horse, and was afraid he must decline. &ldquo;Only
      one horse!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, &ldquo;only one horse!&rdquo; who had heard he had
      ten, &ldquo;ah, well, never mind,&rdquo; thinking he would sell him one. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
      you what I&rsquo;ll do, I&rsquo;ll mount you on the Tuesday&mdash;I&rsquo;ll mount you on
      the Tuesday&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if I won&rsquo;t&mdash;and that&rsquo;ll make it all right&mdash;and
      that&rsquo;ll make all right.&rdquo; So extending his hand he said, &ldquo;Come on Sunday
      then, come on Sunday,&rdquo; and, bowing round to the ladies, he backed out of
      the room lest his friend the Major might appear and open his grievance
      about the horse. Billy then accompanied him to the door, where Sir Moses,
      pointing to the gaudy vehicle, said, &ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s the dog-cart you see,
      there&rsquo;s the dog-cart, much at your service, much at your service,&rdquo; adding,
      as he placed his foot upon the step to ascend, &ldquo;Our friend the Major here
      I make no doubt will lend you a horse to put in it, and between
      ourselves,&rdquo; concluded he in a lower tone, &ldquo;you may as well try if you
      can&rsquo;t get him to lend you a second horse to bring with you.&rdquo; So saying,
      Sir Moses again shook hands most fervently with his young friend, the
      nephew of Sir Jonathan, and mounting the vehicle soused down in his seat
      and drove off with the air of a Jew bailiff in his Sunday best.

    </h4>
    <p>
      Of course, when Billy returned to the drawing-room the young ladies were
      busy discussing the Baronet, aided by Mamma, who had gone up stairs on the
      sound of wheels to reconnoitre her person, and was disappointed on coming
      down to find she had had her trouble for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Sir Moses had been a married man instead of a widower, without
      incumbrance as the saying is, fine Billy would have been more likely to
      have heard the truth respecting him, than he was as matters stood. As it
      was, the ladies had always run Sir Moses up, and did not depart from that
      course on the present occasion. Mrs. Yammerton, indeed, always said that
      he looked a great deal older than he really was, and had no objection to
      his being talked of for one of her daughters, and as courtships generally
      go by contraries, the fair lady of the glove with her light sunny hair,
      and lambent blue eyes, rather admired Sir Moses&rsquo; hook-nose and clear olive
      complexion than otherwise. His jewelry, too, had always delighted her, for
      he had a stock equal to that of any retired pawnbroker. So they impressed
      Billy very favourably with the Baronet&rsquo;s pretensions, far more favourably
      the reader may be sure than the Recorder did the Barons of the Court of
      Exchequer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.<br/>THE HIT-IM AND HOLD-IM SHIRE HOUNDS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ESCENDING Long
      Benningborough Hill on the approach from the west, the reader enters the
      rich vale of Hit-im and Hold-im shire, rich in agricultural productions,
      lavish of rural beauties, and renowned for the strength and speed of its
      foxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a hunting country Hit-im and Hold-im shire ranks next to
      Featherbedfordshire, and has always been hunted by men of wealth and
      renown. The great Mr. Bruiser hunted it at one time, and was succeeded by
      the equally great Mr. Customer, who kept it for upwards of twenty years.
      He was succeeded by Mr. Charles Crasher, after whom came the eminent Lord
      Martingal, who most materially improved its even then almost perfect
      features by the judicious planting of gorse covers on the eastern or
      Droxmoor side, where woodlands are deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during Lord Martingal&rsquo;s reign that Hit-im and Hold-im shire may be
      said to have attained the zenith of its fame, for he was liberal in the
      extreme, not receiving a farthing subscription, and maintaining the Club
      at the Fox and Hounds Hotel at Hinton with the greatest spirit and
      popularity. He reigned over Hit-im and Hold-im shire for the period of a
      quarter of a century, his retirement being at length caused by a fall from
      his horse, aggravated by distress at seeing his favourite gorses
      Rattleford and Chivington cut up by a branch-line of the Crumpletin
      railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his lordship&rsquo;s resignation, the country underwent the degradation of
      passing into the hands of the well-known Captain Flasher, a gentleman who,
      instead of keeping hounds, as Lord Martingal had done, expected the hounds
      to keep him. To this end he organised a subscription&mdash;a difficult
      thing to realise even when men have got into the habit of paying, or
      perhaps promising one&mdash;but most difficult when, as in this case, they
      had long been accustomed to have their hunting for nothing. It is then
      that the beauties of a free pack are apparent. The Captain, however,
      nothing daunted by the difficulty, applied the screw most assiduously,
      causing many gentlemen to find out that they were just going to give up
      hunting, and others that they must go abroad to economise. This was just
      about the gloomy time that our friend the Major was vacillating between
      Boulogne and Bastille; and it so happened that Mr. Plantagenet Brown, of
      Pangburn Park, whose Norman-conquest family had long been pressing on the
      vitals of the estate, taking all out and putting nothing in, suddenly
      found themselves at the end of their tether. The estate had collapsed.
      Then came the brief summing-up of a long career of improvidence in the
      shape of an auctioneer&rsquo;s advertisement, offering the highly valuable
      freehold property, comprising about two thousand five hundred acres in a
      ring fence, with a modern mansion replete with every requisite for a
      nobleman or gentleman&rsquo;s seat, for sale, which, of course, brought the
      usual train of visitors, valuers, Paul-Pryers, and so on&mdash;some
      lamenting the setting, others speculating on the rising sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sale, a most repulsive, poverty-stricken looking little old Jew
      kept protracting the biddings when everybody else seemed done, in such a
      way as to cause the auctioneer to request an <i>imparlance</i>, in order
      that he might ascertain who his principal was; when the Jew, putting his
      dirty hands to his bearded mouth, whispered in the auctioneer&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;Shir
      Moshes Mainchance,&rdquo; whereupon the languid biddings were resumed, and the
      estate was ultimately knocked down to the Baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the ceremony of taking possession&mdash;the carriage-and-four,
      the flags, the band of music, the triumphal arch, the fervid address and
      heartfelt reply, amid the prolonged cheers of the wretched pauperised
      tenantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      That mark of respect over, let us return to the hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Flasher did not give satisfaction, which indeed was not to be
      expected, considering that he wanted a subscription. No man would have
      given satisfaction under the circumstances, but the Captain least of all,
      because he brought nothing into the common stock, nothing, at least,
      except his impudence, of which the members of the hunt had already a
      sufficient supply of their own. The country was therefore declared vacant
      at the end of the Captain&rsquo;s second season, the Guarantee Committee
      thinking it best to buy him off the third one, for which he had contracted
      to hunt it. This was just about the time that Sir Moses purchased Pangburn
      Park, and, of course, the country was offered to him. A passion for
      hunting is variously distributed, and Sir Moses had his share of it. He
      was more than a mere follower of hounds, for he took a pleasure in their
      working and management, and not knowing much about the cost, he jumped at
      the offer, declaring he didn&rsquo;t want a farthing subscription, no, not a
      farthing: he wouldn&rsquo;t even have a cover fund&mdash;no, not even a cover
      fund! He&rsquo;d pay keepers, stoppers, damage, everything himself,&mdash;dom&rsquo;d
      if he wouldn&rsquo;t. Then when he got possession of the country, he declared
      that he found it absolutely indispensable for the promotion of sport, and
      the good of them all, that there should be a putting together of purses&mdash;every
      man ought to have a direct interest in the preservation of foxes, and,
      therefore, they should all pay five guineas,&mdash;just five guineas
      a-year to a cover fund. It wasn&rsquo;t fair that he should pay all the cost&mdash;dom&rsquo;d
      if it was. He wouldn&rsquo;t stand it&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the next season he declared that five guineas was all moonshine&mdash;it
      would do nothing in the way of keeping such a country as Hit-im and
      Hold-im shire together&mdash;it must be ten guineas, and that would leave
      a great balance for him to pay. Well, ten guineas he got, and emboldened
      by his success, at the commencement of the next season he got a grand
      gathering together, at a hand-in-the-pocket hunt dinner at the Fox and
      Hounds Hotel at Hinton, to which he presented a case of champagne, when
      his health being drunk with suitable enthusiasm, he got up and made them a
      most elaborate speech on the pleasures and advantages of fox-hunting,
      which he declared was like meat, drink, washing and lodging to him, and to
      which he mainly attributed the very excellent health which they had just
      been good enough to wish him a continuance of in such complimentary terms,
      that he was almost overpowered by it. He was glad to see that he was not a
      monopoliser of the inestimable blessings of health, for, looking round the
      table, he thought he never saw such an assemblage of cheerful contented
      countenances&mdash;(applause)&mdash;and it was a great satisfaction to him
      to think that he in any way contributed to make them so&mdash;(renewed
      applause). He had been thinking since he came into the room whether it was
      possible to increase in any way the general stock of prosperity&mdash;(great
      applause)&mdash;and considering the success that had already marked his
      humble endeavours, he really thought that there was nothing like sticking
      to the same medicine, and, if possible, increasing the dose; for&mdash;(the
      conclusion of this sentence was lost in the general applause that
      followed). Having taken an inspiriting sip of wine, he thus resumed, &ldquo;He
      now hunted the country three days a-week,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and, thanks to their
      generous exertions, and the very judicious arrangement they had
      spontaneously made of having a hunt club, he really thought it would stand
      four days.&rdquo;&mdash;(Thunders of applause followed this announcement,
      causing the glasses and biscuits to dance jigs on the table. Sir Moses
      took a prolonged sip of wine, and silence being at length again restored,
      he thus resumed):&mdash;&ldquo;It had always stood four in old Martingal&rsquo;s time,
      and why shouldn&rsquo;t it do so in theirs?&mdash;(applause). Look at its
      extent! Look at its splendid gorses! Look at its magnificent woodlands! He
      really thought it was second to none!&rdquo; And so the company seemed to think
      too by the cheering that followed the announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, drawing breath for the grand effort, &ldquo;there
      was only one thing to be considered&mdash;one leetle difficulty to be
      overcome&mdash;but one, which after the experience he had had of their
      gameness and liberality, he was sure they would easily surmount.&rdquo;&mdash;(A
      murmur of &ldquo;O-O-O&rsquo;s,&rdquo; with Hookey Walkers, and fingers to the nose,
      gradually following the speaker.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That <i>leetle</i> difficulty, he need hardly say, was their old familiar
      friend £ s. d.! who required occasionally to be looked in the face.&rdquo;&mdash;(Ironical
      laughter, with <i>sotto voce</i> exclamations from Jack to Tom and from
      Sam to Harry, of&mdash;) &ldquo;I say! <i>three</i> days are <i>quite</i> enough&mdash;<i>quite</i>
      enough. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo; With answers of &ldquo;Plenty! plenty!&rdquo; mingled
      with whispers of, &ldquo;I say, this is what he calls hunting the country for
      nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued Sir Moses, tapping the table with his
      presidential hammer, to assert his monopoly of noise, &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, as
      I said before, I have no doubt we can overcome any difficulty in the
      matter of money&mdash;what&rsquo;s the use of money if it&rsquo;s not to enjoy
      ourselves, and what enjoyment is there equal to fox-hunting? (applause).
      None! none!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, gentlemen, what I was going to say was this: It occurred to me
      this morning as I was shaving myself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you would shave us,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Paul Straddler to Hicks, the
      flying hatter, neither of whom ever subscribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;It occurred to me this morning, as I was shaving myself, that for
      a very little additional outlay&mdash;say four hundred a year&mdash;and
      what&rsquo;s four hundred a-year among so many of us? we might have four days
      a-week, which is a great deal better than three in many respects, inasmuch
      as you have two distinct lots of hounds, accustomed to hunt together,
      instead of a jumble for one day, and both men and horses are in steadier
      and more regular work; and as to foxes, I needn&rsquo;t say we have plenty of
      them, and that they will be all the better for a little more exercise.&mdash;(Applause
      from Sir Moses&rsquo; men, Mr. Smoothley and others). Well, then, say four
      hundred a-year, or, as hay and corn are dear and likely to continue so,
      suppose we put it at the worst, and call it five&mdash;five hundred&mdash;what&rsquo;s
      five hundred a-year to a great prosperous agricultural and commercial
      country like this? Nothing! A positive bagatelle! I&rsquo;d be ashamed to have
      it known at the &lsquo;Corner&rsquo; that we had ever haggled about such a sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pay it, then,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Straddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Catch him doing that,&rdquo; growled Hicks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses here took another sip of sherry, and thus resumed:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, gentlemen, as I said before, it only occurred to me this
      morning as I was shaving, or I would have been better prepared with some
      definite proposal for your consideration, but I&rsquo;ve just dotted down here,
      on the back of one of Grove the fishmonger&rsquo;s cards (producing one from his
      waistcoat pocket as he spoke), the names of those who I think ought to be
      called upon to contribute;&mdash;and, waiter!&rdquo; exclaimed he, addressing
      one of the lanky-haired order, who had just protruded his head in at the
      door to see what all the eloquence was about, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll give me one of
      those mutton fats,&mdash;and your master ought to be kicked for putting
      such things on the table, and you may tell him I said so,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just
      read the names over to you.&rdquo; Sir Moses adjusting his gold double eye
      glasses on his hooked nose as the waiter obeyed his commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said the Baronet, beginning at the top of the list, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve put
      young Lord Polkaton down for fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my Lord doesn&rsquo;t hunt, Sir Moses!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Mossman, his
      Lordship&rsquo;s land-agent, alarmed at the demand upon a very delicate purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t hunt!&rdquo; retorted Sir Moses angrily. &ldquo;No; but he might if he liked!
      If there were no hounds, how the deuce could he? It would do him far more
      good, let me tell him, than dancing at casinos and running after ballet
      girls, as he does. I&rsquo;ve put him down for fifty, however,&rdquo; continued Sir
      Moses, with a jerk of his head, &ldquo;and you may tell him I&rsquo;ve done so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish you may get it,&rdquo; growled Mr. Mossman, with disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the Baronet, proceeding to the next name on the list,
      &ldquo;comes old Lord Harpsichord. He&rsquo;s good for fifty, too, I should say. At
      all events, I&rsquo;ve put him down for that sum;&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no notion of
      those great landed cormorants cutting away to the continent and shirking
      the obligations of country life. I hold it to be the duty of every man to
      subscribe to a pack of fox-hounds. In fact, I would make a subscription a
      first charge upon land, before poor-rate, highway-rate, or any sort of
      rate. I&rsquo;d make it payable before the assessed taxes themselves&rdquo;&mdash;(laughter
      and applause, very few of the company being land-owners). &ldquo;Two fifties is
      a hundred, then,&rdquo; observed Sir Moses, perking up; &ldquo;and if we can screw
      another fifty out of old Lady Shortwhist, so much the better; at all
      events. I think she&rsquo;ll be good for a pony; and then we come to the
      Baronets. First and foremost is that confounded prosy old ass, Sir George
      Persiflage, with his empty compliments and his fine cravats. I&rsquo;ve put him
      down for fifty, though I don&rsquo;t suppose the old sinner will pay it, though
      we may, perhaps, get half, which we shouldn&rsquo;t do if we were not to ask for
      more. Well, we&rsquo;ll call the supercilious old owls five-and-twenty for
      safety,&rdquo; added Sir Moses. &ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s Sir Morgan Wildair; I should think
      we may say five-aud-twenty for him. What say you, Mr. Squeezely?&rdquo;
       appealing to Sir Morgan&rsquo;s agent at the low end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no instructions from Sir Morgan on the subject, Sir Moses,&rdquo; replied
      Mr. Squeezely, shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he&rsquo;s a young man, and you must tell him that it&rsquo;s right&mdash;<i>necessary</i>,
      in fact,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses. &ldquo;You just pay it, and pass it through his
      accounts&mdash;that&rsquo;s the shortest way. It&rsquo;s the duty of an agent to save
      his principal trouble. I wouldn&rsquo;t keep an agent who bothered me with all
      the twopenny-halfpenny transactions of the estate&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if I would,&rdquo;
       said Sir Moses, resuming his eye-glass reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then went on through the names of several other parties, who he thought
      might be coaxed or bullied out of subscriptions, he taking this man,
      another taking that, and working them, as he said, on the fair means
      first, and foul means principle afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, now you see, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, pocketing his card
      and taking another sip of sherry prior to summing up; &ldquo;it just amounts to
      this. Four days a-week, as I said before, is a dom&rsquo;d deal better than
      three, and if we can get the fourth day out of these shabby screws, why so
      much the better; but if that can&rsquo;t be done entirely, it can to a certain
      extent, and then it will only remain for the members of the club and the
      strangers&mdash;by the way, we shouldn&rsquo;t forget them&mdash;it will only
      remain for the members of the club and the strangers to raise any slight
      deficiency by an increased subscription, and according to my plan of each
      man working his neighbour, whether the club subscription was to be
      increased to fifteen, or seventeen, or even to twenty pounds a-year will
      depend entirely upon ourselves; so you see, gentlemen, we have all a
      direct interest in the matter, and cannot go to work too earnestly or too
      strenuously; for believe me, gentlemen, there&rsquo;s nothing like hunting, it
      promotes health and longevity, wards off the gout and sciatica, and keeps
      one out of the hands of those dom&rsquo;d doctors, with their confounded bills&mdash;no
      offence to our friend Plaister, there,&rdquo; alluding to a doctor of that name
      who was sitting about half-way down the table&mdash;&ldquo;so now,&rdquo; continued
      Sir Moses, &ldquo;I think I cannot do better than conclude by proposing as a
      bumper toast, with all the honours, Long life and prosperity to the Hit-im
      and Hold-im shire hounds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the forced cheering had subsided, our friend&mdash;or rather Major
      Yammerton&rsquo;s friend&mdash;Mr. Smoothley, the gentleman who assisted at the
      sale of Bo-peep, arose to address the meeting amid coughs and knocks and
      the shuffling of feet. Mr. Smoothley coughed too, for he felt he had an
      uphill part to perform; but Sir Moses was a hard task-master, and held his
      &ldquo;I. O. U.&lsquo;s&rdquo; for a hundred and fifty-seven pounds. On silence being
      restored, Mr. Smoothley briefly glanced at the topics urged, as he said,
      in such a masterly manner by their excellent and popular master, to whom
      they all owed a deep debt of gratitude for the spirited manner in which he
      hunted the country, rescuing it from the degradation to which it had
      fallen, and restoring it to its pristine fame and prosperity&mdash;(applause
      from Sir Moses and his <i>claqueurs</i>). &ldquo;With respect to the specific
      proposal submitted by Sir Moses, Mr. Smoothley proceeded to say, he really
      thought there could not be a difference of opinion on the subject&mdash;(renewed
      applause, with murmurs of dissent here and there). It was clearly their
      interest to have the country hunted four days a week, and the mode in
      which Sir Moses proposed accomplishing the object was worthy the talents
      of the greatest financier of the day&mdash;(applause)&mdash;for it placed
      the load on the shoulders of those who were the best able to bear it&mdash;(applause).
      Taking all the circumstances of the case, therefore, into consideration,
      he thought the very least they could do would be to pass a unanimous vote
      of thanks to their excellent friend for the brilliant sport he had
      hitherto shown them, and pledge themselves to aid to the utmost of their
      power in carrying out his most liberal and judicious proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewish enough,&rdquo; whispered Mr. Straddler into the flying hatter&rsquo;s ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the following week&rsquo;s Hit-im and Hold-im shire Herald, and also the
      Featherbedfordshire Gazette, contained a string of resolutions, embodying
      the foregoing, as unanimously passed at a full meeting of the members of
      the Hit-im and Hold-im shire hunt, held at the Fox and Hounds Hotel, in
      Ilinton, Sir Moses Mainchance, Bart., in the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      And each man set to work on the pocket of his neighbour with an
      earnestness inspired by the idea of saving his own. The result was that a
      very considerable sum was raised for the four days a-week, which, somehow
      or other, the country rarely or ever got, except in the shape of
      advertisements; for Sir Moses always had some excuse or other for shirking
      it,&mdash;either his huntsman had got drunk the day before, or his first
      whip had had a bad fall, or his second whip had been summoned to the small
      debts court, or his hounds had been fighting and several of them had got
      lamed, or the distemper had broken out in his stable, or something or
      other had happened to prevent him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards Christmas, or on the eve of an evident frost, he came valiantly
      out, and if foiled by a sudden thaw, would indulge in all sorts of sham
      draws, and short days, to the great disgust of those who were not in the
      secret. Altogether Sir Moses Mainchance rode Hit-im and Hold-im shire as
      Hit-im and Hold-im shire had never been ridden before.

      CHAPTER XXIX.<br/>THE PANGBURN PARK ESTATE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE first thing
      that struck Sir Moses Mainchance after he became a &ldquo;laird&rdquo; was that he got
      very little interest for his money. Here he was he who had always looked
      down with scorn upon any thing that would not pay ten per cent., scarcely
      netting three by his acres. He couldn&rsquo;t understand it&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if he
      could. How could people live who had nothing but land? Certainly Mr.
      Plantagenet Smith had left the estate in as forlorn a condition as could
      well be imagined. Latterly his agent, Mr. Tom Teaser, had directed his
      attention solely to the extraction of rent, regardless of maintenance, to
      say nothing of improvements, consequently the farm buildings were
      dilapidated, and the land impoverished in every shape and way. Old
      pasture-field after old pasture-field had gradually succumbed to the
      plough, and the last ounce of freshness being extracted, the fields were
      left to lay themselves down to weeds or any thing they liked. As this sort
      of work never has but one ending, the time soon arrived when the rent was
      not raiseable. Indeed it was the inability to make &ldquo;both ends meet,&rdquo; as
      Paul Pry used to say, which caused Mr. Plantagenet Smith to retire from
      Burke&rsquo;s landed gentry, which he did to his own advantage, land being
      sometimes like family plate, valuable to sell, but unprofitable to keep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses, flushed with his reception and the consequence he had acquired,
      met his tenants gallantly the first rent-day, expecting to find everything
      as smooth and pleasant as a London house-rent audit. Great was his
      surprise and disgust at the pauperised wretches he encountered, creatures
      that really appeared to be but little raised above the brute creation,
      were it not for the uncommon keenness they showed at a &ldquo;catch.&rdquo; First came
      our old friend Henerey Brown &amp; Co., who, foiled in their attempt to
      establish themselves on Major Yammerton&rsquo;s farm at Bonnyrigs, and also upon
      several other farms in different parts of the county, had at length &ldquo;wheas
      we have considered&rdquo; Mr. Teaser to some better purpose for one on the
      Pangburn Park Estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Doblington farm, consisting of a hundred and sixty of undrained
      obdurate clay, as sticky as bird-lime in wet, and as hard as iron in dry
      weather, and therefore requiring extra strength to take advantage of a
      favourable season. Now Henerey Brown &amp; Co. had farmed, or rather
      starved, a light sandy soil of some two-thirds the extent of Doblington,
      and their half-fed pony horses and wretched implements were quite unable
      to cope with the intractable stubborn stuff they had selected. Perhaps we
      can hardly say they selected it, for it was a case of Hobson&rsquo;s choice with
      them, and as they offered more rent than the outgoing tenant, who had
      farmed himself to the door, had paid, Mr. Teaser installed them in it. And
      now at the end of the year, (the farms being let on that beggarly
      pauper-encouraging system of a running half year) Henerey &amp; Humphrey
      came dragging their legs to the Park with a quarter of a year&rsquo;s rent
      between them, Henerey who was the orator undertaking to appear, Humphrey
      paying his respects only to the cheer. Sir Moses and Mr. Teaser were
      sitting in state in the side entrance-hall, surrounded by the usual
      paraphernalia of pens, ink, and paper, when Henerey&rsquo;s short, square
      turnip-headed, vacant-countenanced figure loomed in the distance. Mr.
      Teaser trembled when he saw him, for he knew that the increased rent
      obtained for Henerey&rsquo;s farm had been much dwelt upon by the auctioneer,
      and insisted upon by the vendor as conducive evidence of the improving
      nature of the whole estate. Teaser, like the schoolboy in the poem, now
      traced the day&rsquo;s disaster in Henerey&rsquo;s morning face. However, Teaser put a
      good face on the matter, saying, as Henerey came diverging up to the
      table, &ldquo;This is Mr. Brown, Sir Moses, the new tenant of Doblington&mdash;the
      farm on the Hill.&rdquo; he was going to add &ldquo;with the bad out-buildings,&rdquo; but
      he thought he had better keep that to himself. <i>Humph</i> sniffed the
      eager baronet, looking the new tenant over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sarvent, Sir Moses,&rdquo; ducked the farmer, seating himself in the dread
      cash-extracting chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my man, and how dy&rsquo;e do? I hope you&rsquo;re well&mdash;How&rsquo;s your wife?
      I hope she&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; continued the Baronet, watching Henerey&rsquo;s protracted
      dive into his corduroy breeches-pockets, and his fish up of the dirty
      canvas money-bag. Having deliberately untied the string, Henerey, without
      noticing the Baronet&rsquo;s polite enquiries, shook out a few local five pound
      notes, along with some sovereigns, shillings, and sixpence upon the table,
      and heaving a deep sigh, pushed them over towards Mr. Teaser. That worthy
      having wet his thumb at his mouth proceeded to count the dirty old notes,
      and finding them as he expected, even with the aid of the change, very
      short of the right amount, he asked Henerey if he had any bills against
      them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-h-o-y no-a ar think not,&rdquo; replied Henerey, scratching his
      straggling-haired head, apparently conning the matter over in his mind.
      &ldquo;W-h-o-y, yeas, there&rsquo;s the Income Tax, and there&rsquo;s the lime to &lsquo;loo off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lime!&rdquo; exclaimed the Baronet, &ldquo;What have I to do with lime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-h-o-y, yeas, you know you promised to &lsquo;loo the lime,&rdquo; replied Hererey,
      appealing to Mr. Teaser, who frowned and bit his lip at the over-true
      assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of such a thing!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, seeing through the
      deceit at a glance. &ldquo;Never heard of such a thing,&rdquo; repeated he. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      the way you keep up your rents is it?&rdquo; asked he: &ldquo;Deceive yourselves by
      pretending to get more money than you do, and pay rates and taxes upon
      your deceit as a punishment. That &lsquo;ill not do! dom&rsquo;d if it will,&rdquo;
       continued the Baronet, waxing warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but the income tax won&rsquo;t bring your money up to anything like the
      right amount,&rdquo; observed Mr. Teaser to Henerey, anxious to get rid of the
      lime question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-h-o-y n-o-a,&rdquo; replied Henerey, again scratching his pate, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s as
      much as I can bring ye to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day, man!&rdquo; retorted Sir Moses, &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know that this is the
      rent-day! the day on which the entire monetary transactions on the whole
      estate are expected to be settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Henerey</i>&mdash;&ldquo;O, w-h-o-y it &lsquo;ill make ne odds to ye, Sir Moses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Ne odds to me! How do you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Henerey</i>&mdash;(apologetically) &ldquo;Oh, Sir Moses, you have plenty, Sir
      Moses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Me plenty! me plenty! I&rsquo;m the poorest crittur
      alive!&rdquo; which was true enough, only not in the sense Sir Moses intended
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Henerey</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Why, why, Sir Moses, ar&rsquo;ll bring ye some more after
      a bit; but ar tell ye,&rdquo; appealing to Teaser, &ldquo;<i>Ye mun &lsquo;loo for the lime.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lime be hanged,&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses. &ldquo;Dy&rsquo;e sp&rsquo;ose I&rsquo;m such a fool as
      to let you the land, and farm ye the land, and pay income tax on rent that
      I never receive? That won&rsquo;t do&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if it will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Henerey</i>&mdash;(boiling up) &ldquo;Well, but Sir Moses, wor farm&rsquo;s far
      o&rsquo;er dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>&mdash;(turning flesh-colour with fury) &ldquo;O&rsquo;er dear! Why,
      isn&rsquo;t it the rent you yourself offered for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Henerey</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Why, why, but we hadn&rsquo;t looked her carefully over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigger fool you,&rdquo; ejaculated the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The land&rsquo;s far worse nor we took it for&mdash;some of the plough&rsquo;s a shem
      to be seen&mdash;wor stable rains in desprate&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t a dry
      place for a coo&mdash;the back wall of the barn&rsquo;s all bulgin oot&mdash;the
      pigs get into wor garden for want of a gate&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t a fence &lsquo;ill
      turn a foal&mdash;the hars eat all wor tormots&mdash;we&rsquo;re perfectly
      ruined wi&rsquo; rats,&rdquo; and altogether Henerey opened such a battery of
      grievances as completely drove Sir Moses, who hated anyone to talk but
      himself, from his seat, and made him leave the finish of his friend to Mr.
      Teaser.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Baronet went swinging out of the room he mentally exclaimed, &ldquo;Never
      saw such a man as that in my life&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if ever I did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teaser then proceeded with the wretched audit, each succeeding tenant
      being a repetition of the first&mdash;excuses&mdash;drawbacks&mdash;allowances
      for lime&mdash;money no matter to Sir Moses&mdash;and this with a whole
      year&rsquo;s rent due, to say nothing of hopeless arrears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the deuce,&rdquo; as Sir Moses asked, &ldquo;do people live who have nothing but
      land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Sir Moses returned, at the end of an hour or so, he found one of the
      old tenants of the estate, Jacky Hindmarch, in the chair. Jacky was one of
      the real scratching order of farmers, and ought to be preserved at Madame
      Tussaud&rsquo;s or the British Museum, for the information of future ages. To
      see him in the fields, with his crownless hat and tattered clothes, he was
      more like a scare-crow than a farmer; though, thanks to the influence of
      cheap finery, he turned out very shiney and satiney on a Sunday. Jacky had
      seventy acres of land,&mdash;fifty acres of arable and twenty acres of
      grass, which latter he complimented with an annual mowing without giving
      it any manure in return, thus robbing his pastures to feed his fallows,&mdash;if,
      indeed, he did not rob both by selling the manure off his farm altogether.
      Still Jacky was reckoned a cute fellow among his compatriots. He had
      graduated in the Insolvent Debtors&rsquo; Court to evade his former landlord&rsquo;s
      claims, and emerged from gaol with a good stock of bad law engrafted on
      his innate knavery. In addition to this, Jacky, when a hind, had nearly
      had to hold up his hand at Quarter Sessions for stealing his master&rsquo;s
      corn, which he effected in a very ingenious way:&mdash;The granary being
      above Jacky&rsquo;s stable, he bored a hole through the floor, to which he
      affixed a stocking; and, having drawn as much corn as he required, he
      stopped the hole up with a plug until he wanted a fresh supply. The farmer&mdash;one
      Mr. Podmore&mdash;at length smelt a rat; but giving Jacky in charge rather
      prematurely, he failed in substantiating the accusation, when the latter,
      acting &ldquo;under advice,&rdquo; brought an action against Podmore, which ended in a
      compromise, Podmore having to pay Jacky twenty pounds for robbing him!
      This money, coupled with the savings of a virtuous young woman he
      presently espoused, and who had made free with the produce of her master&rsquo;s
      dairy, enabled Jacky to take the farm off which he passed through the
      Insolvent Debtors&rsquo; Court, on to the Pangburn Park estate, where he was
      generally known by the name of Lawyer Hindmarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacky and his excellent wife attempted to farm the whole seventy acres
      themselves; to plough, harrow, clean, sow, reap, mow, milk, churn,&mdash;do
      everything, in fact; consequently they were always well in arrear with
      their work, and had many a fine run after the seasons. If Jacky got his
      turnips in by the time other people were singling theirs, he was thought
      to do extremely well. To see him raising the seed-furrow in the autumn, a
      stranger would think he was ploughing in a green crop for manure, so
      luxuriant were the weeds. But Jacky Hindmarch would defend his system
      against Mr. Mechi himself; there being no creature so obstinate or
      intractable as a pig-headed farmer. A landlord had better let his land to
      a cheesemonger, a greengrocer, a draper, anybody with energy and capital,
      rather than to one of these self-sufficient, dawdling nincompoops. To be
      sure, Jacky farmed as if each year was to be his last, but he wouldn&rsquo;t
      have been a bit better if he had had a one-and-twenty years&rsquo; lease before
      him. &ldquo;Take all out and put nothing in,&rdquo; was his motto. This was the genius
      who was shuffling, and haggling, and prevaricating with Mr. Teaser when
      Sir Moses returned, and who now gladly skulked off: Henerey Brown not
      having reported very favourably of the great man&rsquo;s temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next to come was a woman,&mdash;a great, mountainous woman&mdash;one
      Mrs. Peggy Turnbull, wife of little Billy Turnbull of Lowfield Farm, who,
      she politely said, was not fit to be trusted from home by hisself.&mdash;Mrs.
      Turnbull was, though, being quite a match for any man in the country,
      either with her tongue or her fists. She was a great masculine
      knock-me-down woman, round as a sugar-barrel, with a most extravagant
      stomach, wholly absorbing her neck, and reaching quite up to her chin.
      Above the barrel was a round, swarthy, sunburnt face, lit up with a pair
      of keen little twinkling beady black eyes. She paused in her roll as she
      neared the chair, at which she now cast a contemptuous look, as much as to
      say, &ldquo;How can I ever get into such a thing as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Teaser saw her dilemma and kindly gave her the roomier one on which he
      was sitting&mdash;while Sir Moses inwardly prepared a little dose of
      politeness for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my good woman,&rdquo; said he as soon as she got soused on to the seat.
      &ldquo;Well, my good woman, how dy&rsquo;e do? I hope you&rsquo;re well. How&rsquo;s your husband?
      I hope he&rsquo;s well;&rdquo; and was proceeding in a similar strain when the monster
      interrupted his dialogue by thumping the table with her fist, and
      exclaiming at the top of her voice, as she fixed her little beady black
      eyes full upon him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>D&rsquo;ye think we&rsquo;re ganninn to get a new B-a-r-r-u-n?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dom you and your b-a-r-r-n!&rdquo; exclaimed the Baronet, boiling up. &ldquo;Why
      don&rsquo;t you leave those things to your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s see shy!</i>&rdquo; roared the monster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not shy, however!&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, again jumping up and running
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus what with one and another of them, Sir Moses was so put out, that
      dearly as he loved a let off for his tongue, he couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to
      face his friends again at dinner. So the agreeable duty devolved upon Mr.
      Teaser, of taking the chair, and proposing in a bumper toast, with all the
      honours and one cheer more, the health of a landlord who, it was clear,
      meant to extract the uttermost farthing he could from his tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that day&rsquo;s proceedings furnished ample scope for a beginning, for
      there was not one tenant on the estate who paid up; and Sir Moses declared
      that of all the absurdities he had ever heard tell of in the whole course
      of his life, that of paying income-tax on money he didn&rsquo;t receive was the
      greatest. &ldquo;Dom&rsquo;d if it wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact the estate had come to a stand still, and wanted nursing instead
      of further exhaustion. If it had got into the hands of an improving owner&mdash;a
      Major Yammerton, for instance,&mdash;there was redemption enough in the
      land; these scratching fellows, only exhausting the surface; and draining
      and subsoiling would soon have put matters right, but Sir Moses declared
      he wouldn&rsquo;t throw good money after bad, that the rushes were meant to be
      there and there they should stay. If the tenants couldn&rsquo;t pay their rents
      how could they pay any drainage interest? he asked. Altogether Sir Moses
      declared it shouldn&rsquo;t be a case of over shoes, over boots, with him&mdash;that
      he wouldn&rsquo;t go deeper into the mud than he was, and he heartily wished he
      had the price of the estate back in his pocket again, as many a man has
      wished, and many a one will wish again&mdash;there being nothing so
      ticklish to deal with as land. There is no reason though why it should be
      so; but we will keep our generalities for another chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses&rsquo;s property went rapidly back, and soon became a sort of last
      refuge for the destitute, whither the ejected of all other estates
      congregated prior to scattering their stock, on failing to get farms in
      more favoured localities. As they never meant to pay, of course they all
      offered high rents, and then having got possession the Henerey Brown scene
      was enacted&mdash;the farm was &ldquo;far o&rsquo;er dear&rdquo;&mdash;they could &ldquo;make
      nout on&rsquo;t at that rent!&rdquo; nor could they have made aught on them if they had
      had them for nothing, seeing that their capital consisted solely of their
      intense stupidity. Then if Sir Moses wouldn&rsquo;t reduce the rent, he might
      just do his &ldquo;warst,&rdquo; meanwhile they pillaged the land both by day and by
      night. The cropping of course corresponded with the tenure, and may be
      described as just anything they could get off the land. White crop
      succeeded white crop, if the weeds didn&rsquo;t smother the seeds, or if any of
      the slovens did &ldquo;try for a few turnips,&rdquo; as they called it, they were sown
      on dry spots selected here and there, with an implement resembling a
      dog&rsquo;s-meat man&rsquo;s wheelbarrow&mdash;drawn by one ass and steered by
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr. Teaser&rsquo;s labours increased considerably, what with the
      constant lettings and leavings and watchings for &ldquo;slopings.&rdquo; There was
      always some one or other of the worthies on the wing, and the more paper
      and words Mr. Teaser employed to bind them, the more inefficient and
      futile he found the attempt. It soon became a regular system to do the new
      landlord, in furtherance of which the tenants formed themselves into a
      sort of mutual aid association. Then when a seizure was effected, they
      combined not to buy, so that the sufferer got his wretched stock back at
      little or no loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wretched indeed, was the spectacle of a sale; worn out horses, innocent of
      corn; cows, on whose hips one could hang one&rsquo;s hat; implements that had
      been &ldquo;fettled oop&rdquo; and &ldquo;fettled oop,&rdquo; until not a particle of the parent
      stock remained; carts and trappings that seemed ready for a bonfire; pigs,
      that looked as if they wanted food themselves instead of being likely to
      feed any one else; and poultry that all seemed troubled with the pip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very bailiff&rsquo;s followers were shocked at the emptiness of the larders.
      A shank bone of salt meat dangling from the ceiling, a few eggs on a
      shelf, a loaf of bread in a bowl, a pound of butter in a pie-dish,&mdash;the
      whole thing looking as unlike the plentiful profusion of a farm-house as
      could well be imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arduous duties of the office, combined with the difficulty of pleasing
      Sir Moses, at length compelled Mr. Teaser to resign, when our &ldquo;laird,&rdquo;
       considering the nature of the services required concluded that there could
      be no one so fit to fulfil them as one of the &ldquo;peoplish.&rdquo; Accordingly he
      went to town, and after Consulting Levy this, and &ldquo;Goodman&rdquo; that, and
      Ephraim t&rsquo;other, he at length fixed upon that promising swell, young Mr.
      Mordecai Nathan, of Cursitor-street, whose knowledge of the country
      consisted in having assisted in the provincial department of his father&rsquo;s
      catchpoll business in the glorious days of writs and sponging-houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time down came Mordecai, ringed and brooched and chained and
      jewelled, and as Sir Moses was now the great man, hunting the country,
      associating with Lord Oilcake, and so on, he gave Mordecai a liberal
      salary, four-hundred a year made up in the following clerical way:

    <p>
      Besides, which, Sir Moses promised him ten per cent, upon all recovered
      arrears, which set Mordecai to work with all the enthusiastic energy of
      his race.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NE of the most
      distinguishing features between commerce and agriculture undoubtedly is
      the marked indifference shown to the value of time by the small followers
      of the latter, compared to the respectful treatment it receives at the
      hands of the members of the commercial world. To look at their relative
      movements one would think that the farmer was the man who carried on his
      business under cover, instead of being the one who exposes all his
      capital to the weather. It is a rare thing to see a farmer&mdash;even in
      hay time&mdash;in a hurry. If the returns could be obtained we dare say
      it would be found that three-fourths of the people who are late for
      railway trains are farmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these accelerated days, when even the very street waggon horses trot,
      they are the only beings whose pace has not been improved. The small
      farmer is just the same slowly moving dawdling creature that he was before
      the perfection of steam. Never punctual, never ready, never able to give a
      direct answer to a question; a pitchfork at their backs would fail to push
      some of these fellows into prosperity. They seem wholly lost to that
      emulative spirit which actuates the trader to endeavour to make each
      succeeding year leave him better than the last. A farmer will be forty
      years on a farm without having benefited himself, his family, his
      landlord, or any human being whatever. The last year&rsquo;s tenancy will find
      him as poor as the first, with, in all probability, his land a great deal
      poorer. In dealing, a small farmer is never happy without a haggle. Even
      if he gets his own price he reproaches hiself when he returns home with
      not having asked a little more, and so got a wrangle. Very often, however,
      they outwit themselves entirely by asking so much more than a thing is
      really worth, that a man who knows what he is about, and has no hopes of
      being able to get the sun to stand still, declines entering upon an
      apparently endless negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      See lawyer Hindmarch coming up the High Street at Halterley fair, leading
      his great grey colt, with his landlord Sir Moses hailing him with his
      usual &ldquo;Well my man, how d&rsquo;ye do? I hope you&rsquo;re well, how much for the
      colt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer&rsquo;s keen intellect&mdash;seeing that it is his landlord, with
      whom he is well over the left&mdash;springs a few pounds upon an already
      exorbitant price, and Sir Moses, who can as he says, measure the horse out
      to ninepence, turns round on his heel with a chuck of his chin, as much as
      to say, &ldquo;you may go on.&rdquo; Then the lawyer relenting says, &ldquo;w&mdash;h&mdash;o&mdash;y,
      but there&rsquo;ll be summit to return upon that, you know, Sir Moses, Sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; replies the Baronet, walking away, to &ldquo;Well my man&mdash;how
      d&rsquo;ye do? I hope you&rsquo;re well,&rdquo; somebody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sale by auction of agricultural stock illustrates our position still
      further, and one remarkable feature is that the smaller the sale the more
      unpunctual people are. They seldom get begun under a couple of hours after
      the advertised time, and then the dwelling, the coaxing, the wrangling,
      the &ldquo;puttings-up&rdquo; again, the ponderous attempts at wit are painful and
      oppressive to any one accustomed to the easy gliding celerity of town
      auctioneers. A conference with a farmer is worse, especially if the party
      is indiscreet enough to let the farmer come to him instead of his going to
      the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chances, then, are, that he is saddled with a sort of old man of the
      sea; as a certain ambassador once was with a gowk of an Englishman, who
      gained an audience under a mistaken notion, and kept sitting and sitting
      long after his business was discussed, in spite of his Excellency&rsquo;s
      repeated bows and intimations that he might retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gowk seemed quite insensible to a hint. In vain his Excellency stood
      bowing and bowing&mdash;hoping to see him rise. No such luck. At length
      his Excellency asked him if there was anything else he could do for him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, noa.&rdquo; replied Gowk drily; adding after a pause, &ldquo;but you haven&rsquo;t
      asked me to dine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!&rdquo; replied his Excellency, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t aware that it
      was in my instructions, but I&rsquo;ll refer to them and see,&rdquo; added he, backing
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us fancy old Heavyheels approaching his landlord, to ask if he thinks
      they are gannin to get a new barrun, or anything else he may happen to
      want, for these worthies have not discovered the use of the penny-post,
      and will trudge any distance to deliver their own messages. Having got
      rolled into the room, the first thing Heels does is to look out for a
      seat, upon which he squats like one of Major Yammerton&rsquo;s hares, and from
      which he is about as difficult to raise. Instead of coming out with his
      question as a trader would, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s rum? what&rsquo;s sugar? what&rsquo;s indigo?&rdquo; he
      fixes his unmeaning eyes on his landlord, and with a heavy aspiration, and
      propping his chin up with a baggy umbrella, ejaculates&mdash;&ldquo;<i>N-o-o</i>,&rdquo; just
      as if his landlord had sent for him instead of his having come of his own
      accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; says the landlord briskly, in hopes of getting him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a foine day,&rdquo; observes Heavyheels, as if he had nothing whatever on
      his mind, and so he goes maundering and sauntering on, wasting his own and
      his landlord&rsquo;s time, most likely ending with some such preposterous
      proposition as would stamp any man for a fool if it wasn&rsquo;t so decidedly in
      old Heavyheel&rsquo;s own favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give them their due, they are never shy about asking, and have always a
      host of grievances to bait a landlord with who gives them an opportunity.
      Some of the women&mdash;we beg their pardon&mdash;ladies of the
      establishments, seem to think that a landlord rides out for the sake of
      being worried, and rush at him as he passes like a cur dog at a beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether they are a wonderful breed! It will hardly be credited
      hereafter, when the last of these grubbing old earthworms is extinct, that
      in this anxious, commercial, money-striving country, where every man is
      treading on his neighbour&rsquo;s heels for cash, that there should ever have
      been a race of men who required all the coaxing and urging and patting on
      the back to induce them to benefit themselves that these slugs of small
      tenant farmers have done. And the bulk of them not a bit better for it.
      They say &ldquo;y-e-a-s,&rdquo; and go and do the reverse directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancy our friend Goodbeer, the brewer, assembling his tied Bonnifaces at a
      banquet consisting of all the delicacies of the season&mdash;beef, mutton,
      and cheese, as the sailor said&mdash;and after giving the usual loyal and
      patriotic toasts, introducing his calling in the urgent way some landlords
      do theirs&mdash;pointing out that the more swipes they sell the greater
      will be their profit, recommending them to water judiciously, keeping the
      capsicum out of sight, and, in lieu of some new implement of husbandry,
      telling them that a good, strong, salt Dutch cheese, is found to be a
      great promoter of thirst, and recommending each man to try a cheese on
      himself&mdash;perhaps ending by bowling one at each of them by way of a
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      But some will, perhaps, say that the interests of the landlord and
      tenant-farmer are identical, and that you cannot injure the latter without
      hurting the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not more identical, we submit, than the interests of Goodbeer with the
      Bonnifaces; the land is let upon a calculation what each acre will
      produce, just as Goodbeer lets a public-house on a calculation founded on
      its then consumption of malt liquor; and whatever either party makes
      beyond that amount, either through the aid of guano, Dutch cheese, or what
      not, is the tenant&rsquo;s. The only difference we know between them is, that
      Goodbeer, being a trader, will have his money to the day; while in course
      of time the too easy landlord&rsquo;s rent has become postponed to every other
      person&rsquo;s claim. It is, &ldquo;O, it will make ne matter to you, Sir Moses,&rdquo; with
      too many of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, if that convenient view is acquiesced in, the party submitting is
      called a &ldquo;good landlord&rdquo; (which in too many instances only means a great
      fool), until some other favour is refused, when the hundredth one denied
      obliterates the recollection of the ninety-nine conferred, and he sinks
      into a &ldquo;rank bad un.&rdquo; The best landlord, we imagine, is he who lets his
      land on fair terms, and keeps his tenants well up to the mark both with
      their farming and their payments. At present the landlords are too often a
      sort of sleeping partners with their tenants, sharing with them the losses
      of the bad years without partaking with them in the advantages of the good
      ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s all dom&rsquo;d well,&rdquo; we fancy we hear Sir Moses Mainchance exclaim,
      &ldquo;saying, &lsquo;keep them up to the mark,&rsquo; but how d&rsquo;ye do it? how d&rsquo;ye do it?
      can you bind a weasel? No man&rsquo;s tried harder than I have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We grant that it is difficult, but agriculture never had such
      opportunities as it has now. The thing is to get rid of the weasels, and
      with public companies framed for draining, building, doing everything that
      is required without that terrible investigation of title, no one is
      justified in keeping his property in an unproductive state. The fact is
      that no man of capital will live in a cottage, the thing therefore is to
      lay a certain number of these small holdings together, making one good
      farm of them all, with suitable buildings, and, as the saying is, let the
      weasels go to the wall. They will be far happier and more at home with
      spades or hoes in their hands, than in acting a part for which they have
      neither capital, courage, nor capacity. Fellows take a hundred acres who
      should only have five, and haven&rsquo;t the wit to find out that it is cheaper
      to buy manure than to rent land.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a question of crinoline or taste that might be advantageously
      left to Mrs. Pringle; but is one that concerns the very food and well
      being of the people, and landlords ought not to require coaxing and
      patting on the back to induce them to partake of the cheese that the
      commercial world offers them. Even if they are indifferent about
      benefiting themselves they should not be regardless of the interests for
      their country. But there are very few people who cannot spend a little
      more money than they have. Let them &ldquo;up then and at&rdquo; the drainage
      companies, and see what wonders they&rsquo;ll accomplish with their aid!
    </p>
    <p>
      We really believe the productive powers of the country might be
      quadrupled.

      now a magnate of the land, associating with Lord Oilcake, Lord Repartee,
      Sir Harry Fuzball and other great dons, of course had to live up to the
      mark, an inconvenient arrangement for those who do not like paying for it,
      and the consequence was that he had to put up with an inferior article.&mdash;take
      first-class servants who had fallen into second-class circumstances. He
      had a ticket-of-leave butler, a <i>delirium tremens</i> footman, and our
      old friend pheasant-feathers, now calling herself Mrs. Margerum, for cook
      and house-keeper. And first, of the butler. He was indeed a magnificent
      man, standing six feet two and faultlessly proportioned, with a commanding
      presence of sufficient age to awe those under him, and to inspire
      confidence in an establishment with such a respectable looking man at the
      head. Though so majestic, he moved noiselessly, spoke in a whisper, and
      seemed to spirit the things off the table without sound or effort. Pity
      that the exigencies of gambling should have caused such an elegant man to
      melt his master&rsquo;s plate, still greater that he should have been found out
      and compelled to change the faultless white vest of upper service for the
      unbecoming costume of prison life. Yet so it was: and the man who was
      convicted as Henry Stopper, and sentenced to fourteen years&rsquo; 
      transportation, emerged at the end of four with a ticket-of-leave, under
      the assumed name of Demetrius Bankhead. Mr. Bankhead, knowing the sweets
      of office, again aspired to high places, but found great difficulty in
      suiting himself, indeed in getting into service at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      People who keep fine gentlemen are very chary and scrupulous whom they
      select, and extremely inquisitive and searching in their inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain Mr. Bankhead asserted that he had been out of health and living on
      the Continent, or that he had been a partner in a brewery which hadn&rsquo;t
      succeeded, or that his last master was abroad he didn&rsquo;t know where, and
      made a variety of similar excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though many fine ladies and gentlemen were amazingly taken with him at
      first, and thought he would grace their sideboards uncommonly, they were
      afraid to touch for fear &ldquo;all was not right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then those of a lower grade, thought he wouldn&rsquo;t apply to them after
      having lived in such high places as he described, and this notwithstanding
      Bankhead&rsquo;s plausible assertion, that he wished for a situation in a quiet
      regular family in the country, where he could get to bed at a reasonable
      hour, instead of being kept up till he didn&rsquo;t know when. He would even
      come upon trial, if the parties liked, which would obviate all inquiries
      about character; just as if a man couldn&rsquo;t run off with the plate the
      first day as well as the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our readers, we dare say, know the condescending sort of gentleman &ldquo;who
      will accept of their situations,&rdquo; and who deprecate an appeal to their
      late masters by saying in an airified sort of way, with a toss of the head
      or a wave of the hand, that they told his Grace or Sir George they
      wouldn&rsquo;t trouble to ask them for characters. Just as if the Duke or Sir
      George were infinitely beneath their notice or consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again the sort of men who flourish a bunch of testimonials, skilfully
      selecting the imposing passages and evading the want of that connecting
      link upon which the whole character depends, and who talk in a patronising
      way of &ldquo;poor lord this,&rdquo; or &ldquo;poor Sir Thomas that,&rdquo; and what they would
      have done for them if they had been alive, poor men!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Demetrius Bankhead tried all the tricks of the trade&mdash;we beg
      pardon&mdash;profession&mdash;wherever he heard of a chance, until hope
      deferred almost made his noble heart sick. The &ldquo;puts off&rdquo; and excuses he
      got were curiously ingenious. However, he was pretty adroit himself, for
      when he saw the parties were not likely to bite, he anticipated a refusal
      by respectfully declining the situation, and then saying that he might
      have had so and so&rsquo;s place, only he wanted one where he should be in town
      half the year, or that he couldn&rsquo;t do with only one footman under him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was under stress of circumstances that Sir Moses Mainchance became
      possessed of Mr. Bankhead&rsquo;s services. He had kicked his last butler (one
      of the fine characterless sort) out of the house for coming in drunk to
      wait at dinner, and insisting upon putting on the cheese first with the
      soup, then with the meat, then with the sweets, and lastly with the
      dessert; and as Sir Moses was going to give one of his large hunt dinners
      shortly after, it behoved him to fill up the place&mdash;we beg pardon&mdash;office&mdash;as
      quickly as possible. To this end he applied to Mrs. Listener, the
      gossiping Register Office-keeper of Hinton, a woman well calculated to
      write the history of every family in the county, for behind her screen
      every particular was related, and Mrs. Listener, having paraded all the
      wretched glazey-clothed, misshapen creatures that always turn up on such
      occasions, Sir Moses was leaving after his last visit in disgust, when Mr.
      Bankhead walked in&mdash;&ldquo;quite promiscuous,&rdquo; as the saying is, but by
      previous arrangement with Mrs. Listener. Sir Moses was struck with
      Bankhead&rsquo;s air and demeanour, so quiet, so respectful, raising his hat as
      he met Sir Moses at the door, that he jumped to the conclusion that he
      would do for him, and returning shortly after to Mrs. Listener, he asked
      all the usual questions, which Mrs. Listener cleverly evaded, merely
      saying that he professed to be a perfect butler, and had several most
      excellent testimonials, but that it would be much better for Sir Moses to
      judge for himself, for really Mrs. Listener had the comfort of Sir Moses
      so truly at heart that she could not think of recommending any one with
      whom she was not perfectly conversant, and altogether she palavered him so
      neatly, always taking care to extol Bankhead&rsquo;s personal appearance as
      evidence of his respectability, that the baronet was fairly talked into
      him, almost without his knowing it, while Mrs. Listener salved her own
      conscience with the reflection that it was Sir Moses&rsquo;s own doing, and that
      the bulk of his plate was &ldquo;Brummagem&rdquo; ware&mdash;and not silver. So the
      oft-disappointed ticket-of-leaver was again installed in a butlers pantry.
      And having now introduced him, we will pass over the delirium tremens
      footman and arrive at that next important personage in an establishment,
      the housekeeper, in this case our old friend pheasant&rsquo;s-feathers. Mrs.
      Margerum, late Sarey Grimes, the early coach companion and confidante of
      our fair friend Mrs. Pringle&mdash;had undergone the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;ungenerous
      scorn,&rdquo; as well for having set up an adopted son, as for having been
      turned away from many places for various domestic peculations. Mrs.
      Margerum, however, was too good a judge to play upon anything that anybody
      could identify, consequently though she was often caught, she always had
      an answer, and would not unfrequently turn the tables on her accusers&mdash;lawyer
      Hindmarch like&mdash;and make them pay for having been robbed. No one knew
      better than Mrs. Margerum how many feathers could be extracted from a bed
      without detection, what reduction a horse-hair mattress would stand, or
      how to make two hams disappear under the process of frying one. Indeed she
      was quite an adept in housekeeping, always however preferring to live with
      single gentlemen, for whom she would save a world of trouble by hiring all
      the servants, thus of course having them well under her thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses having suffered severely from waste, drunkenness and incapacity,
      had taken Mrs. Margerum on that worst of all recommendations, the
      recommendation of another servant&mdash;viz., Lord Oilcake&rsquo;s cook, for
      whom Mrs. Margerum had done the out-door carrying when in another
      situation. Mrs. Margerum&rsquo;s long career, coupled with her now having a son
      equal to the out-door department, established a claim that was not to be
      resisted when his lordship&rsquo;s cook had a chance, on the application of Sir
      Moses, of placing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Margerum entered upon her duties at Pangburn Park, with the greatest
      plausibility, for not content with the usual finding fault with all the
      acts of her predecessors, she absolutely &ldquo;reformed the butcher&rsquo;s bills,&rdquo;
       reducing them nearly a pound a-week below what they had previously been,
      and showed great assiduity in sending in all the little odds and ends of
      good things that went out. To be sure the hams disappeared rather quickly,
      but then they <i>do</i> cut so to waste in frying, and the cows went off
      in their milk, but cows are capricious things, and Mrs. Hindmarch and she
      had a running account in the butter and egg line, Mrs. Hindmarch
      accommodating her with a few pounds of butter and a few score of eggs when
      Sir Moses had company, Mrs. Margerum repaying her at her utmost
      convenience, receiving the difference in cash, the repayment being always
      greatly in excess of the advance. Still as Mrs. Margerum permitted no
      waste, and allowed no one to rob but herself, the house appeared to be
      economically kept, and if Sir Moses didn&rsquo;t think that she was a &ldquo;charming
      woman,&rdquo; he at all events considered he was a most fortunate man, and felt
      greatly indebted to Lord Oilcake&rsquo;s cook for recommending her&mdash;&ldquo;dom&rsquo;d
      if he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But though Mrs. Margerum kept the servants well up to their tea and sugar
      allowances, she granted them every indulgence in the way of gadding about,
      and also in having their followers, provided the followers didn&rsquo;t eat, by
      which means she kept the house quiet, and made her reign happy and
      prosperous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being in full power when Mr. Bankhead came, she received him with the
      greatest cordiality, and her polite offer of having his clothes washed in
      Sir Moses&rsquo;s laundry being accepted, of course she had nothing to fear from
      Mr. Bankhead. And so they became as they ought to be, very good friends&mdash;greatly
      to Sir Moses&rsquo;s advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the out-door department of Sir Moses&rsquo;s ménage. The hunting
      establishment was of the rough and ready order, but still the hounds
      showed uncommon sport, and if the horses were not quite up to the mark,
      that perhaps was all in favour of the hounds. The horses indeed were of a
      very miscellaneous order&mdash;all sorts, all sizes, all better in their
      wind than on their legs&mdash;which were desperately scored and
      iron-marked. Still the cripples could go when they were warm, and being
      ridden by men whose necks were at a discount, they did as well as the
      best. There is nothing like a cheap horse for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses&rsquo;s huntsman was the noted Tom Findlater, a man famous for
      everything in his line except sobriety, in which little item he was sadly
      deficient. Tom would have been quite at the top of the tree if it hadn&rsquo;t
      been for this unfortunate infirmity. &ldquo;The crittur,&rdquo; as a Scotch huntsman
      told Sir Moses at Tattersall&rsquo;s, &ldquo;could no keep itself sober.&rdquo; To show the
      necessities to which this degrading propensity reduces a man, we will
      quote Tom&rsquo;s description of himself when he applied to be discharged under
      the Insolvent Debtors&rsquo; Act before coming to Sir Moses. Thus it ran&mdash;&ldquo;John
      Thomas Findlater known also as Tom Find&rsquo;ater, formerly huntsman to His
      Grace the Duke of Streamaway, of Streamaway Castle, in Streamaway-shire,
      then of No. 6, Back Row, Broomsfield, in the county of Tansey, helper in a
      livery stable, then huntsman to Sampson Cobbyford, Esq., of Bluntfield
      Park, master of the Hugger Mugger hounds in the county of Scramblington,
      then huntsman to Sir Giles Gatherthrong, Baronet, of Clipperley Park, in
      the county of Scurry, then huntsman to the Right Honourable Lord Lovedale,
      of Gayhurst Court, in the county of Tipperley, then of No. 11, Tan Yard
      Lane, Barrenbin, in the county of Thistleford, assistant to a ratcatcher,
      then huntsman to Captain Rattlinghope, of Killbriton Castle, in the County
      Steepleford, then whipper-in to the Towrowdeshire hounds in
      Derrydownshire, then helper at the Lion and the Lamb public-house at
      Screwford, in the County of Mucklethrift, then of 6 1/2 Union Street, in
      Screwford, aforesaid, moulder to a clay-pipe maker, then and now out of
      business and employ, and whose wife is a charwoman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such were the varied occupations of a man, who might have lived like a
      gentleman, if he had only had conduct. There is no finer place than that
      of a huntsman, for as Beckford truly says, his office is pleasing and at
      the same time flattering, he is paid for that which diverts him, nor is a
      general after a victory more proud, than is a huntsman who returns with
      his fox&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sir Moses fell in with Tom Findlater down Tattersall&rsquo;s entry, Tom was
      fresh from being whitewashed in the Insolvent Debtors&rsquo; Court, and having
      only ninepence in the world, and what he stood up in, he was uncommonly
      good to deal with. Moreover, Sir Moses had the vanity to think that he
      could reclaim even the most vicious; and, provided they were cheap enough,
      he didn&rsquo;t care to try. So, having lectured Tom well on the importance of
      sobriety, pointing out to him the lamentable consequences of drunkenness&mdash;of
      which no one was more sensible than Tom&mdash;Sir Moses chucked him a
      shilling, and told him if he had a mind to find his way down to Pangburn
      Park, in Hit-im-and-Hold-im shire, he would employ him, and give him what
      he was worth; with which vague invitation Tom came in the summer of the
      season in which we now find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now having sketched the ménage, let us introduce our friend Billy
      thereto. But first we must get him out of the dangerous premises in which
      he is at present located&mdash;a visit that has caused our handsome friend
      Mrs. Pringle no little uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for Sir Moses Mainchance, and unfortunate for our friend
      Fine Billy, that the Baronet was a bachelor, or Sir Moses would have fared
      very differently at the hands of the ladies who seldom see much harm in a
      man so long as he is single, and, of course, refrains from showing a
      decided preference for any young lady. It is the married men who
      monopolise all the vice and improprieties of life. The Major, too, having
      sold Billy a horse, and got paid for him, was not very urgent about his
      further society at present, nor indisposed for a little quiet, especially
      as Mrs. Yammerton represented that the napkins and table-linen generally
      were running rather short. Mamma, too, knowing that there would be nothing
      but men-parties at Pangburn Park, had no uneasiness on that score, indeed
      rather thought a little absence might be favourable, in enabling Billy to
      modify his general attentions in favour of a single daughter, for as yet
      he had been extremely dutiful in obeying his Mamma&rsquo;s injunctions not to be
      more agreeable to one sister than to another. Indeed, our estimable young
      friend did not want to be caught, and had been a good deal alarmed at the
      contents of his Mamma&rsquo;s last letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing, however, was settled, namely, that Billy was to go to the Park,
      and how to get there was the next consideration; for, though the Baronet
      had offered to convey him in the first instance, he had modified the offer
      into the loan of the gig at the last, and there would be more trouble in
      sending a horse to fetch it, than there would be in starting fair in a
      hired horse and vehicle from Yammerton Grange. The ready-witted Major,
      however, soon put matters right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll te te tell you wot,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you can do. You can have old Tommy
      P-p-plumberg, the registrar of b-b-births, deaths, and marriages, t-t-trap
      for a trifle&mdash;s-s-say, s-s-seven and sixpence&mdash;only you must
      give him the money as a p-p-present, you know, not as it were for the
      hire, or the Excise would be down upon him for the du-du-duty, and
      p-p-p&rsquo;raps fine him into the b-b-bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, that seemed all right and feasible enough, and most likely would
      have been all right if Monsieur had proposed it; but, coming from master,
      of course Monsieur felt bound to object.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It vouldn&rsquo;t hold alf a quarter their things,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;besides, how de
      deuce were they to manage with de horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major essayed to settle that, too. There would be no occasion for Mr.
      Pringle to take all his things with him, as he hoped he would return to
      them from Sir Moses&rsquo;s and have another turn with the haryers&mdash;try if
      they couldn&rsquo;t circumvent the old hare that had beat them the other day,
      and the thing would be for Mr. Pringle to ride his horse quietly over,
      Monsieur going in advance with the gig, and having all things ready
      against Mr. Pringle arrived; for the Major well knew that the Baronet&rsquo;s
      promises were not to be depended upon, and would require some little
      manouvering to get carried out, especially in the stable department.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there was a difficulty&mdash;Monsieur couldn&rsquo;t drive. No, by his
      vord, he couldn&rsquo;t drive. He was <i>valet-de-chambre</i>, not coachman or
      grum, and could make nothing of horses. Might know his ear from his tail,
      but dat was all. Should be sure to opset, and p&rsquo;raps damage his crown.
      (Jack wanted to go in a carriage and pair.) Well, the Major would
      accommodate that too. Tom Cowlick, the hind&rsquo;s lad at the farm, should act
      the part of charioteer, and drive Monsieur, bag, baggage and all. And so
      matters were ultimately settled, it never occurring to Billy to make the
      attempt on the Major&rsquo;s stud that the Baronet proposed, in the shape of
      borrowing a second horse, our friend doubtless thinking he carried
      persecution enough in his own nag. The knotty point of transit being
      settled, Billy relapsed into his usual easy languor among the girls, while
      Monsieur made a judicious draft of clothes to take with them, leaving him
      a very smart suit to appear in at church on Sunday, and afterwards ride
      through the county in. We will now suppose the dread hour of departure
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just as Mrs. Pringle predicted! There were the red eye-lids and
      laced kerchiefs, and all the paraphernalia of leave-taking, mingled with
      the hopes of Major and Mrs. Yammerton, that Billy would soon return (after
      the washing, of course); for, in the language of the turf, Billy was
      anybody&rsquo;s game, and one sister had just as good a right to red eye-lids as
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen Billy through the ceremony of leave-taking, the Major then
      accompanied him to the stable, thinking to say a word for himself and his
      late horse &lsquo;ere they parted. After admiring Napoleon the Great&rsquo;s
      condition, as he stood turned round in the stall ready for mounting, the
      Major observed casually, &ldquo;that he should not be surprised if Sir Moses
      found fault with that &lsquo;oss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Billy, who expected perfection for a hundred guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-d-don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the Major, with a Jack Rogers&rsquo; shrug of the
      shoulders. &ldquo;D-d-don&rsquo;t know, &lsquo;cept that Sir Moses seldom says a good word
      for anybody&rsquo;s &lsquo;oss but his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clothes being then swept over the horse&rsquo;s long tail into the manger,
      he stepped gaily out, followed by our friend and his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it b-b-better to send your servant on,&rdquo; observed the Major
      confidentially, as he stood eyeing the gay deceiver of a horse: &ldquo;for,
      between ourselves, the Baronet&rsquo;s stables are none of the best, and it will
      give you the opportunity of getting the pick of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, who did not enter into the delicacies of
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ho-ho-horse requires w-w-warmth,&rdquo; stuttered the Major, &ldquo;and Sir
      Moses&rsquo;s stables are both d-d-damp and d-d-dirty;&rdquo; saying which, he
      tendered his ungloved hand, and with repeated hopes that Billy would soon
      return, and wishes for good sport, not forgetting compliments to the
      Baronet, our hero and his host at length parted for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Major breathed more freely as he saw the cock-horse capering round
      the turn into the Helmington road.

     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ROM Yammerton
      Grange to Pangburn Park is twelve miles as the crow flies, or sixteen by
      the road. The Major, who knows every nick and gap in the country, could
      ride it in ten or eleven; but this species of knowledge is not to be
      imparted to even the most intelligent head. Not but what the Major tried
      to put it into Billy&rsquo;s, and what with directions to keep the Helmington
      road till he came to the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, then to turn up the crooked
      lane on the left, leaving Wanley windmill on the right, and Altringham
      spire on the left, avoiding the village of Rothley, then to turn short at
      Samerside Hill, keeping Missleton Plantations full before him, with
      repeated assurances that he couldn&rsquo;t miss his way, he so completely
      bewildered our friend, that he was lost before he had gone a couple of
      miles. Then came the provoking ignorance of country life,&mdash;the
      counter-questions instead of answers,&mdash;the stupid stare and tedious
      drawl, ending, perhaps, with &ldquo;ars a stranger,&rdquo; or may be the utter
      negation of a place within, perhaps, a few miles of where the parties
      live. Billy blundered and blundered; took the wrong turning up the crooked
      lane, kept Wanley windmill on the left instead of the right, and finally
      rode right into the village of Rothley, and then began asking his way. It
      being Sunday, he soon attracted plenty of starers, such an uncommon swell
      being rare in the country; and one told him one way; another, another; and
      then the two began squabbling as to which was the right one, enlisting of
      course the sympathies of the bystanders, so that Billy&rsquo;s progress was
      considerably impeded. Indeed, he sometimes seemed to recede instead of
      advance, so contradictory were the statements as to distance, and the
      further be went the further he seemed to have to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Sir Moses hadn&rsquo;t been pretty notorious as well from hunting the country
      as from his other performances, we doubt whether Billy would have reached
      Pangburn Park that night. As it was, Sir Moses&rsquo;s unpopularity helped Billy
      along in a growling uncivil sort of way, so different to the usual
      friendly forwarding that marks the approach to a gentleman&rsquo;s house in the
      country.

      wouldn&rsquo;t visit such a chap. &ldquo;Aye, that&rsquo;s the way&mdash;straight on,
      through Addingham town&rdquo;&mdash;for every countryman likes to have his
      village called a town&mdash;&ldquo;straight on through Addingham town, keep the
      lane on the left, and then when ye come to the beer-shop at three road
      ends, ax for the Kingswood road, and that&rsquo;ll lead ye to the lodges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All roads are long when one has to ask the way&mdash;the distance seems
      nearly double in going to a place to what it does in returning, and Billy
      thought he never would get to Pangburn Park. The shades of night, too,
      drew on&mdash;Napoleon the Great had long lost his freedom and gaiety of
      action, and hung on the bit in a heavy listless sort of way. Billy wished
      for a policeman to protect and direct him. Lights began to be scattered
      about the country, and day quickly declined in favour of night. The
      darkening mist gathered perceptibly. Billy longed for those lodges of
      which he had heard so much, but which seemed ever to elude him. He even
      appeared inclined to compound for the magnificence of two by turning in at
      Mr. Pinkerton&rsquo;s single one. By the direction of the woman at this one, he
      at length reached the glad haven, and passing through the open portals was
      at length in Pangburn Park. The drab-coloured road directed him onward,
      and Billy being relieved from the anxieties of asking his way, pulled up
      into a walk, as well to cool his horse as to try and make out what sort of
      a place he had got to. With the exception, however, of the road, it was a
      confused mass of darkness, that might contain trees, hills, houses,
      hay-stacks, anything. Presently the melodious cry of hounds came wafted on
      the southerly breeze, causing our friend to shudder at the temerity of his
      undertaking. &ldquo;Drat these hounds,&rdquo; muttered he, wishing he was well out of
      the infliction, and as he proceeded onward the road suddenly divided, and
      both ways inclining towards certain lights, Billy gave his horse his
      choice, and was presently clattering on the pavement of the court-yard of
      Pangburn Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses&rsquo;s hospitality was rather of a spurious order; he would float his
      friends with claret and champagne, and yet grudge their horses a feed of
      corn. Not but that he was always extremely liberal and pressing in his
      offers, begging people would bring whatever they liked, and stay as long
      as they could, but as soon as his offers were closed with, he began to
      back out. Oh, he forgot! he feared he could only take in one horse; or if
      he could take in a horse he feared he couldn&rsquo;t take in the groom. Just as
      he offered to lend Billy his gig and horse and then reduced the offer into
      the loan of the gig only. So it was with the promised two-stalled stable.
      When Monsieur drove, or rather was driven, with folded arms into the
      court-yard, and asked for his &ldquo;me lors stable,&rdquo; the half-muzzy groom
      observed with a lurch and a hitch of his shorts, that &ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t take in
      (hiccup) osses there&mdash;leastways to stop all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, but you&rsquo;ll put up me lor Pringle&rsquo;s,&rdquo; observed Jack with an air of
      authority, for he considered that he and his master were the exceptions to
      all general rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear we can&rsquo;t (hiccup) it,&rdquo; replied the blear-eyed caitiff; &ldquo;got as many
      (hiccup) osses comin to-night as ever we have room for. Shall have to
      (hiccup) two in a (hiccup) as it is&rdquo; (hiccup).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you can stow him away somewhere,&rdquo; now observed Mr. Demetrius
      Bankhead, emerging from his pantry dressed in a pea-green wide-awake, a
      Meg Merrilies tartan shooting-jacket, a straw-coloured vest, and drab
      pantaloons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s gentleman, I presume,&rdquo; observed Bankhead, now
      turning and bowing to Jack, who still retained his seat in the gig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I be, sare,&rdquo; replied Jack, accepting the proffered hand of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you&rsquo;ll put him up somewhere, Fred,&rdquo; observed Bankhead, appealing
      again to the groom, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll take no harm anywhere,&rdquo; looking at the hairy,
      heated animal, &ldquo;put &lsquo;im in the empty cow-house,&rdquo; adding &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only for one
      night&mdash;only for one night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dis is not the quadruped,&rdquo; observed Monsieur, nodding at the cart mare
      before him, &ldquo;dis is a job beggar vot ve can kick out at our pleasure, but
      me lor is a cornin&rsquo; on his own proper cheval, and he vill vant space and
      conciliation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll manage him somehow,&rdquo; observed Bankhead confidently, &ldquo;only we&rsquo;ve
      a large party to-night, and want all the spare stalls we can raise, but
      they&rsquo;ll put &lsquo;im up somewhere,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll put &lsquo;im up somewhere,&rdquo;
       observing as before, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only for one night&mdash;only for one night.
      Now won&rsquo;t you alight and walk in,&rdquo; continued he, motioning Monsieur to
      descend, and Jack having intimated that his lor vould compliment their
      politeness if they took vell care of his &lsquo;orse, conceived he had done all
      that a faithful domestic could under the circumstances, and leaving the
      issue in the hands of fate, alighted from his vehicle, and entering by the
      back way, proceeded to exchange family &ldquo;particulars&rdquo; with Mr. Bankhead in
      the pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Pangburn Park stables were originally very good, forming a
      crescent at the back of the house, with coach-houses and servants&rsquo; rooms
      intervening, but owing to the trifling circumstance of allowing the drains
      to get choked, they had fallen into disrepute. At the back of the crescent
      were some auxiliary stables, worse of course than the principal range,
      into which they put night-visitors&rsquo; horses, and those whose owners were
      rash enough to insist upon Sir Moses fulfilling his offers of hospitality
      to them. At either end of these latter were loose boxes, capable of being
      made into two-stalled stables, only these partitions were always
      disappearing, and the roofs had long declined turning the weather; but
      still they were better than nothing, and often formed receptacles for sly
      cabby&rsquo;s, or postboys who preferred the chance of eleemosynary fare at Sir
      Moses&rsquo;s to the hand in the pocket hospitality of the Red Lion, at
      Fillerton Hill, or the Mainchance Arms, at Duckworth Bridge. Into the
      best of these bad boxes the gig mare was put, and as there was nothing to
      get in the house, Tom Cowlick took his departure as soon as she had eaten
      her surreptitious feed of oats. The pampered Napoleon the Great, the horse
      that required all the warmth and coddling in the world, was next
      introduced, fine Billy alighting from his back in the yard with all the
      unconcern that he would from one of Mr. Splint&rsquo;s or Mr. Spavins&rsquo;s week day
      or hour jobs. Indeed, one of the distinguishing features between the new
      generation of sportsmen and the old, is the marked indifference of the
      former to the comforts of their horses compared to that shown by the old
      school, who always looked to their horses before themselves, and not
      unfrequently selected their inns with reference to the stables.
      Now-a-days, if a youth gives himself any concern about the matter, it will
      often only be with reference to the bill, and he will frequently ride away
      without ever having been into the stable. If, however, fine Billy had seen
      his, he would most likely have been satisfied with the comfortable
      assurance that it was &ldquo;only for one night,&rdquo; the old saying, &ldquo;enough to
      kill a horse,&rdquo; leading the uninitiated to suppose that they are very
      difficult to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Pringle!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, rising from the depths of a
      rather inadequately stuffed chair (for Mrs. Margerum had been at it). &ldquo;Ah,
      my dear Pringle, I&rsquo;m delighted to see you!&rdquo; continued the Baronet, getting
      Billy by both hands, as the noiseless Mr. Bankhead, having opened the
      library door, piloted him through the intricacies of the company. Our host
      really was glad of a new arrival, for a long winter&rsquo;s evening had
      exhausted the gossip of parties who in a general way saw quite enough, if
      not too much, of each other. And this is the worst of country visiting in
      winter; people are so long together that they get exhausted before they
      should begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have let off the steam of their small talk, and have nothing left to
      fall back upon but repetition. One man has told what there is in the
      &ldquo;Post,&rdquo; another in &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; a third in the &ldquo;Mark Lane Express,&rdquo; and then
      they are about high-and-dry for the rest of the evening. From criticising
      Billy, they had taken to speculating upon whether he would come or not,
      the odds&mdash;without which an Englishmen can do nothing&mdash;being
      rather in favour of Mrs. Yammerton&rsquo;s detaining him. It was not known that
      Monsieur Rougier had arrived. The mighty problem was at length solved by
      the Richest Commoner in England appearing among them, and making the usual
      gyrations peculiar to an introduction. He was then at liberty for ever
      after to nod or speak or shake hands with or bow to Mr. George and Mr.
      Henry Waggett, of Kitteridge Green, both five-and-twenty pound subscribers
      to the Hit-im and Hold-im-shire hounds, to Mr. Stephen Booty, of Verbena
      Lodge, who gave ten pounds and a cover, to Mr. Silverthorn, of Dryfield,
      who didn&rsquo;t give anything, but who had two very good covers which he had
      been hinting he should require to be paid for,&mdash;a hint that had
      procured him the present invitation, to Mr. Strongstubble, of Buckup Hill,
      and Mr. Tupman, of Cowslip Cottage, both very good friends to the sport
      but not &ldquo;hand in the pocket-ites,&rdquo; to Mr. Tom Dribbler, Jun., of
      Hardacres, and his friend Captain Hurricane, of Her Majesty&rsquo;s ship
      Thunderer, and to Mr. Cuthbert Flintoff, commonly called Cuddy Flintoff,
      an &ldquo;all about&rdquo; sportsman, who professed to be of all hunts but blindly
      went to none. Cuddy&rsquo;s sporting was in the past tense, indeed he seemed to
      exist altogether upon the recollections of the chace, which must have made
      a lively impression upon him, for he was continually interlarding his
      conversation with view holloas, yoicks wind &lsquo;ims! yoick&rsquo;s push &lsquo;im ups!
      Indeed, in walking about he seemed to help himself along with the aid of
      for-rardson! for-rards on! so that a person out of sight, but within
      hearing, would think he was hunting a pack of hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed the sportsman, too, most assiduously, bird&rsquo;s-eye cravats,
      step-collared striped vests, green or Oxford-grey cutaways, with the
      neatest fitting trousers on the best bow-legs that ever were seen. To see
      him at Tattersall&rsquo;s sucking his cane, his cheesy hat well down on his
      nose, with his stout, well-cleaned doe-skin gloves, standing criticising
      each horse, a stranger would suppose that he lived entirely on the saddle,
      instead of scarcely ever being in one. On the present occasion, as soon as
      he got his &ldquo;bob&rdquo; made to our Billy, and our hero&rsquo;s back was restored to
      tranquillity, he at him about the weather,&mdash;how the moon looked,
      whether there were any symptoms of frost, and altogether seemed
      desperately anxious about the atmosphere. This inquiry giving the
      conversation a start in the out-of-doors line, was quickly followed by Sir
      Moses asking our Billy how he left the Major, how he found his way there,
      with hopes that everything was comfortable, and oh! agonising promise!
      that he would do his best to show him sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assembled guests then took up the subject of their &ldquo;magnificent
      country&rdquo; generally, one man lauding its bottomless brooks, another its
      enormous bullfinches, a third its terrific stone walls, a fourth its
      stupendous on-and-offs, a fifth its flying foxes, and they unanimously
      resolved that the man who could ride over Hit-im and Hold-im-shire could
      ride over any country in the world. &ldquo;<i>Any country in the world!</i>&rdquo;
       vociferated Cuddy, slowly and deliberately, with a hearty crack of his fat
      thigh. And Billy, as he sat listening to their dreadful recitals, thought
      that he <i>had</i> got into the lion&rsquo;s den with a vengeance. Most
      sincerely he wished himself back at the peaceful pursuits of Yammerton
      Grange. Then, as they were in full cry with their boasting eulogiums, the
      joyful dressing-bell rang, and Cuddy Flintoff putting his finger in his
      ear, as if to avoid deafening himself, shrieked, &ldquo;<i>hoick halloa! hoick!</i>&rdquo;
       in a tone that almost drowned the sound of the clapper. Then when the
      &ldquo;ticket of leaver&rdquo; and the <i>delirium tremens</i> footman appeared at the
      door with the blaze of bedroom candles, Cuddy suddenly turned whipper-in,
      and working his right arm as if he were cracking a whip, kept holloaing, &ldquo;<i>get
      away hoick! get away hoick!</i>&rdquo; until he drove Billy and Baronet and all
      before him.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ****
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rum fellow that,&rdquo; observed the Baronet, now showing Billy up to his room,
      as soon as he had got sufficient space put between them to prevent Cuddy
      hearing, &ldquo;Rum fellow that,&rdquo; repeated he, not getting a reply from our
      friend, who didn&rsquo;t know exactly how to interpret the word &ldquo;rum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow&rsquo;s up to everything,&mdash;cleverest fellow under the sun,&rdquo;
       continued Sir Moses, now throwing open the door of an evident bachelor&rsquo;s
      bed-room. Not but that it was one of the best in the house, only it was
      wretchedly furnished, and wanted all the little neatnesses and
      knic-knaceries peculiar to a lady-kept house. The towels were few and
      flimsy, the soap hard and dry, there was a pincushion without pins, a
      portfolio without paper, a grate with a smoky fire, while the feather-bed
      and mattress had been ruthlessly despoiled of their contents. Even the
      imitation maple-wood sofa on which Billy&rsquo;s dress-clothes were now laid,
      had not been overlooked, and was as lank and as bare as a third-rate
      Margate lodging-house, one&mdash;all ribs and hollows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you are!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, pointing to the garments, &ldquo;There
      you are!&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the bell at the back of your bed,&rdquo; pointing
      to one of the old smothering order of four-posters with its dyed moreen
      curtains closely drawn, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the bell at the back of the bed, and
      when you come down we shall be in the same room as we were before.&rdquo; So
      saying, the Baronet retired, leaving our Billy to commence operations.

      struck such of our readers as have followed the chace for more than the
      usual average allowance of three seasons, that hunts flourish most
      vigorously where there is a fair share of hospitality, and Sir Moses
      Mainchance was quite of that opinion. He found it answered a very good
      purpose as well to give occasional dinners at home as to attend the club
      meetings at Hinton. To the former he invited all the elite of his field,
      and such people as he was likely to get anything out of while the latter
      included the farmers and yeomen, the Flying Hatters, the Dampers, and so
      on, whereby, or by reason or means whereof, as the lawyers say, the spirit
      of the thing was well sustained. His home parties were always a great
      source of annoyance to our friend Mrs. Margerum, who did not like to be
      intruded upon by the job cook (Mrs. Pomfret, of Hinton), Mrs. Margerum
      being in fact more of a housekeeper than a cook, though quite cook enough
      for Sir Moses in a general way, and perhaps rather too much of a
      housekeeper for him&mdash;had he but known it. Mrs. Pomfret, however,
      being mistress of Mrs. Margerum&rsquo;s secret (viz., who got the dripping), the
      latter was obliged to &ldquo;put up&rdquo; with her, and taking her revenge by hiding
      her things, and locking up whatever she was likely to want. Still, despite
      of all difficulties, Mrs. Pomfret, when sober, could cook a very good
      dinner, and as Sir Moses allowed her a pint of rum for supper, she had no
      great temptation to exceed till then. She was thought on this occasion, if
      possible, to surpass herself, and certainly Sir Moses&rsquo;s dinner contrasted
      very favourably with what Billy Pringle had been partaking of at our
      friend Major Yammerton&rsquo;s, whose cook had more energy than execution. In
      addition to this, Mr. Bankhead plied the fluids most liberally, as the
      feast progressed, so that what with invitations to drink, and the regular
      course of the tide, the party were very happy and hilarious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after dinner, the hot chestnuts and filberts and anchovy toasts
      mingling with an otherwise excellent desert flavoured the wine and brought
      out no end of &ldquo;yoicks wind &lsquo;ims&rdquo; and aspirations for the morrow. They all
      felt as if they could ride&mdash;Billy and all!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not any more, thank you,&rdquo; being at length the order of the day, a move
      was made back to the library, a drawing-room being a superfluous luxury
      where there is no lady, and tea and coffee were rung for. A new subject of
      conversation was wanted, and Monsieur presently supplied the deficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a Frenchman, that servant of yours, isn&rsquo;t he, Pringle?&rdquo; asked Sir
      Moses, when Monsieur retired with the tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, feeling his trifling moustache after its dip in
      the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought so,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Moses, who prided himself upon his penetration.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a word with him when he comes in again,&rdquo; continued he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea followed quickly on the heels of coffee, Monsieur coming in after
      Bankhead. Monsieur now consequentially drank, and dressed much in the
      manner that he is in the picture of the glove scene at Yammerton Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah, Monsieur! comment vous portez-vous?</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the Baronet,
      which was about as much French as he could raise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty middlin&rsquo;, tenk you, sare,&rdquo; replied Jack, bowing and grinning at
      the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you speak English, do you?&rdquo; asked the Baronet, thinking he might as
      well change the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spake it, sare, some small matter, sare,&rdquo; replied Jack, with a shrug of
      his shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;Not nothing like my modder&rsquo;s tongue, you knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you speak it domd well,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses. &ldquo;Let you and I have a
      talk together. Tell me, now, were you ever out hunting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jean Rougier</i>. &ldquo;Oh, yes, sare, I have been at the chasse of de small
      dicky-bird&mdash;tom-tit&mdash;cock-robin&mdash;vot you call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i> (laughing). &ldquo;No, no, that is not the sort of chace I
      mean; I mean, have you ever been out fox-hunting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Jean Rougier</i> (confidentially). &ldquo;Nevare, sare&mdash;nevare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses. &ldquo;Ah, my friend, then you&rsquo;ve a great pleasure to come to&mdash;a
      great pleasure to come to, indeed. Well, you&rsquo;re a domd good feller, and
      I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      mount you to-morrow&mdash;domd if I won&rsquo;t&mdash;you shall ride my old
      horse, Cockatoo&mdash;carry you beautifully. What d&rsquo;ye ride? Thirteen
      stun, I should say,&rdquo; looking Jack over, &ldquo;quite up to that&mdash;quite up
      to that&mdash;stun above it, for that matter. You&rsquo;ll go streaming away
      like a bushel of beans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sare, I tenk you, sare,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;but I have not got my hunting
      apparatus&mdash;my mosquet&mdash;my gun, my&mdash;no, not notin at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gun!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, amidst the laughter of the company. &ldquo;Why, you
      wouldn&rsquo;t shoot the fox, would ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Certainement</i>&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;I should pop him over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the devil!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, throwing up his hands in
      astonishment. &ldquo;Why, man, we keep the hounds on purpose to hunt him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly fellers,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;you should pepper his jacket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur, I see you have a deal to learn,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Moses,
      laughing. &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s never too late to begin&mdash;never too late to
      begin, and you shall take your first lesson to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll mount you on
      old Cockatoo, and you shall see how we manage these matters in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sare, I tenk you moch,&rdquo; replied Jack, again excusing himself. &ldquo;But I
      have not got no breeches, no boot-jacks&mdash;no notin, <i>comme il faut</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you everything you want,&mdash;a boot-jack and all,&rdquo; replied
      Sir Moses, now quite in the generous mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sare, you are vare beautiful, and I moch appreciate your benevolence;
      bot I sud not like to risk my neck and crop outside an unqualified,
      contradictory quadruped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, &ldquo;nothing of the sort! He&rsquo;s the
      quietest, gentlest crittur alive&mdash;a child might ride him, mightn&rsquo;t
      it, Cuddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safest horse under the sun,&rdquo; replied Cuddy Flintoff, confidently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      know such another. Have nothing to do but sit on his back, and give him
      his head, and he&rsquo;ll take far better care of you than you can of him. He&rsquo;s
      the nag to carry you close up to their stems. <i>Ho-o-i-ck, forrard,
      ho-o-i-ck!</i> Dash my buttons, Monsieur, but I think I see you sailing
      away. Shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you were to bring home the brush, only
      you&rsquo;ve got one under your nose as it is,&rdquo; alluding to his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack at this looked rather sour, for somehow people don&rsquo;t like to be
      laughed at; so he proceeded to push his tray about under the guests&rsquo; 
      noses, by way of getting rid of the subject. He had no objection to a
      hunt, and to try and do what Cuddy Flintoff predicted, only he didn&rsquo;t want
      to spoil his own clothes, or be made a butt of. So, having had his say, he
      retired as soon as he could, inquiring of Bankhead, when he got out, who
      that porky old fellow with the round, close-shaven face was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the second flight of tea-cups came in, Sir Moses was seated on a
      hardish chaise longue, beside our friend Mr. Pringle, to whom he was doing
      the agreeable attentive host, and a little of the inquisitive stranger;
      trying to find out as well about the Major and his family, as about Billy
      himself, his friends and belongings. The Baronet had rather cooled on the
      subject of mounting Monsieur, and thought to pave the way for a back-out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a stout-built feller of yours,&rdquo; observed he to Billy, kicking up
      his toe at Jack as he passed before them with the supplementary tray of
      cakes and cream, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; drawled Billy, wondering what matter it made to Sir Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stouter than I took him for,&rdquo; continued the Baronet, eyeing Jack&rsquo;s broad
      back and strong undersettings. &ldquo;That man&rsquo;ll ride fourteen stun, I dessay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy had no opinion on the point so began admiring his pretty foot;
      comparing it with Sir Moses&rsquo;s, which was rather thick and clumsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baronet conned the mount matter over in his mind; the man was heavy;
      the promised horse was old and weak; the country deep, and he didn&rsquo;t know
      that Monsieur could ride,&mdash;altogether he thought it wouldn&rsquo;t do. Let
      his master mount him if he liked, or let him stay at home and help
      Bankhead with the plate, or Peter with the shoes. So Sir Moses settled it
      in his own mind, as far as he was concerned, at least, and resumed his
      enquiries of our Billy. Which of the Miss Yammertons he thought the
      prettiest, which sang the best, who played the harp, if the Major indulged
      him with much hare-soup, and then glanced incidentally at his stud, and
      Bo-Peep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then asked him about Lord Ladythorne; if it was true that Mrs. Moffatt
      and he quarrelled; if his lordship wasn&rsquo;t getting rather slack; and
      whether Billy didn&rsquo;t think Dicky Boggledale an old woman, to which latter
      interrogatory he replied, &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo;&mdash;he thought he was, and ought to
      be drafted.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the <i>tête-à-tête</i> was going on, a desultory conversation ensued
      among the other guests in various parts of the room, Mr. Booty
      button-holeing Captain Hurricane, to tell him a capital thing out of
      &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; and receiving in return an exclamation of&mdash;&ldquo;Why, man, I told
      you that myself before dinner.&rdquo; Tom Dribbler going about touching people
      up in the ribs with his thumb, inquiring with a knowing wink of his eye,
      or a jerk of his head, &ldquo;Aye, old feller, how goes it;&rdquo; which was about the
      extent of Tom&rsquo;s conversational powers. Henry Waggett talking &ldquo;wool&rdquo; to Mr.
      Tupman; while Cuddy Flintoff kept popping out every now and then to look
      at the moon, returning with a &ldquo;hoick wind &lsquo;im; ho-ick!&rdquo; or&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;A southerly wind and a cloudy sky,
Proclaimeth a hunting morning.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Very cheering the assurance was to our friend Billy Pringle, as the reader
      may suppose; but he had the sense to keep his feelings to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the last act of the entertainment approached, by the door flying
      open through an invisible agency, and the <i>delirium tremens</i> footman
      appearing with a spacious tray, followed by Bankhead and Monsieur, with
      &ldquo;Cardigans&rdquo; and other the materials of &ldquo;night-caps,&rdquo; which they placed on
      the mirth-promoting circle of a round table. All hands drew to it like
      blue-bottle-flies to a sugar-cask, as well to escape from themselves and
      each other, as to partake of the broiled bones, and other the good things
      with which the tray was stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hie, worry! worry! worry!&rdquo; cried Cuddy Flintoff, darting at the black
      bottles, for he dearly loved a drink, and presently had a beaker of
      brandy, so strong, that as Silverthorn said, the spoon almost stood
      upright in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get chairs!&rdquo; exclaimed he, turning short round on his heel: &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
      get chairs, and be snug; it&rsquo;s as cheap sitting as standing,&rdquo; so saying, he
      wheeled a smoking chair up to the table, and was speedily followed by the
      rest of the party, with various shaped seats. Then such of the guests as
      wanted to shirk drinking took whiskey or gin, which they could dilute as
      much as they chose; while those who didn&rsquo;t care for showing their
      predilection for drink, followed Cuddy&rsquo;s example, and made it as strong as
      they liked. This is the time that the sot comes out undisguisedly. The
      form of wine-drinking after dinner is mere child&rsquo;s play in their
      proceedings: the spirit is what they go for.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length sots and sober ones were equally helped to their liking; and,
      the approving sips being taken, the other great want of life&mdash;tobacco&mdash;then
      became apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smoking allowed here,&rdquo; observed Cuddy Flintoff, diving into his
      side-pocket for a cigar, adding, as he looked at the wretched old red
      chintz-covered furniture, which, not even the friendly light of the <i>moderateur</i>
      lamps could convert into anything respectable: &ldquo;No fear of doing any harm
      here, I think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the rest of the company seemed to think, for there was presently a
      great kissing of cigar-ends and rising of clouds, and then the party
      seeming to be lost in deep reveries. Thus they sat for some minutes, some
      eyeing their cocked-up toes, some the dirty ceiling, others smoking and
      nursing their beakers of spirit on their knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Tom Dribbler gave tongue&mdash;&ldquo;What time will the hounds leave
      the kennel in the morning, Sir Moses?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoick to Dribbler! Hoick!&rdquo; immediately cheered Cuddy&mdash;as if capping
      the pack to a find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why, let me see,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, filliping the ashes off the end
      of his cigar&mdash;&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; repeated he&mdash;&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;tomorrow&rsquo;s
      Monday; Monday, the Crooked Billet&mdash;Crooked Billet&mdash;nine miles&mdash;eight
      through Applecross Park; leave here at nine&mdash;ten to nine, say&mdash;nothing
      like giving them plenty of time on the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; assented Cuddy Flintoff, taking a deep drain at his glass,
      adding, as soon as he could get his nose persuaded to come out of it
      again, &ldquo;I <i>do</i> hate to see men hurrying hounds to cover in a
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No fear of mine doing that,&rdquo; observed Sir Moses, &ldquo;for I always go with
      them myself when I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital dodge, too,&rdquo; assented Cuddy, &ldquo;gets the fellers past the public
      houses&mdash;that drink&rsquo;s the ruin of half the huntsmen in England;&rdquo;
       whereupon he took another good swig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, Monsieur, and you&rsquo;ll all go together, I suppose,&rdquo; interrupted
      Dribbler, who wanted to see the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur, Monsieur&mdash;oh, ah, that&rsquo;s my friend Pringle&rsquo;s valet,&rdquo;
       observed Sir Moses, drily; &ldquo;what about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why he&rsquo;s going, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; replied Dribbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, poor fellow, no,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Moses; &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t want to go&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      no use persecuting a poor devil because a Frenchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I dare say he&rsquo;d enjoy it very much,&rdquo; observed Dribbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, will you mount him?&rdquo; asked Sir Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I thought <i>you</i> were going to do it,&rdquo; replied Dribbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Me</i> mount him!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, throwing out his ringed hands
      in well-feigned astonishment, as if he had never made such an offer&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Me</i>
      mount him! why, my dear fellow, do you know how many people I have to
      mount as it is? Let me tell you,&rdquo; continued he, counting them off on his
      fingers, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Tom, and there&rsquo;s Harry, and there&rsquo;s Joe, and there&rsquo;s the
      pad-groom and myself, five horses out every day&mdash;generally six, when
      I&rsquo;ve a hack&mdash;six horses a day, four days a week&mdash;if that isn&rsquo;t
      enough, I don&rsquo;t know what is&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if I do,&rdquo; added he, with a snort
      and a determined jerk of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but we can manage him a mount among us, somehow, I dare say,&rdquo;
       persevered Dribbler, looking round upon the now partially smoke-obscured
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, let him alone, poor fellow; let him alone,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses,
      coaxingly, adding, &ldquo;he evidently doesn&rsquo;t wish to go&mdash;evidently
      doesn&rsquo;t wish to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; exclaimed Cuddy Flintoff, with a knowing jerk of his
      head; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that&mdash;I should say he&rsquo;s rather a y-o-o-i-cks wind
      &lsquo;im! y-o-i-eks push &lsquo;im up! sort of chap.&rdquo; So saying, Cuddy drained his
      glass to the dregs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say you&rsquo;re rather a y-o-i-eks wind &lsquo;im&mdash;y-o-i-cks drink &lsquo;im
      up sort of chap,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, at which they all laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuddy availed himself of the <i>divertissement</i> to make another equally
      strong brew&mdash;saying, &ldquo;It was put there to drink, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; at which
      they all laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there was a disposition to harp upon the hunt&mdash;Dribbler tied on
      the scent, and felt disposed to lend Jack a horse if nobody else would. So
      he threw out a general observation, that he thought they could manage a
      mount for Monsieur among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but perhaps his master mayn&rsquo;t, like it,&rdquo; suggested Sir Moses, in
      hopes that Billy would come to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t care about it,&rdquo; replied Billy, with an air of indifference,
      who would have been glad to hunt by deputy if he could, and so that chance
      fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hoick to Governor! Hoick to Governor!</i>&rdquo; cheered Cuddy at the
      declaration. &ldquo;Now who&rsquo;ll lend him a horse?&rdquo; asked he, taking up the
      question. &ldquo;What say you, Stub?&rdquo; appealing to Mr. Strongstubble, who
      generally had more than he could ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a beefey beggar,&rdquo; replied Strongstubble, between the whiffs of
      a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ah, and a Frenchman too!&rdquo; interposed Sir Moses, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have no idea
      of saving a horse, or holding a horse together, or making the most of a
      horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him on one that &lsquo;ll take care of himself,&rdquo; suggested Cuddy; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
      your old Nutcracker horse, for instance,&rdquo; added he, addressing himself to
      Harry Waggett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got six drachms of aloes,&rdquo; replied Waggett, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or your Te-to-tum, Booty,&rdquo; continued Cuddy, nothing baffled by the
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lame all round,&rdquo; replied Booty, following suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hut you and your lames,&rdquo; rejoined Cuddy, who knew better&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
      you what you must do then, Tommy,&rdquo; continued he, addressing himself
      familiarly to Dribbler, &ldquo;you must lend him your old kicking chestnut&mdash;the
      very horse for a Frenchman,&rdquo; added Cutty, slapping his own tight-trousered
      leg&mdash;&ldquo;you send the Shaver to the Billet in the morning along with
      your own horse, and old Johnny Crapaud will manage to get there somehow or
      other&mdash;walk if he can&rsquo;t ride: shoemaker&rsquo;s pony&rsquo;s very safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll send him in my dog-cart if that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses,
      again waxing generous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &lsquo;ll do! That &lsquo;ll do!&rdquo; replied Cuddy, appealing triumphantly to the
      brandy. Then as the out-door guests began to depart, and the in-door ones
      to wind up their watches and ask about breakfast, Cuddy took advantage of
      one of Sir Moses&rsquo; momentary absences in the entrance hall to walk off to
      bed with the remainder of the bottle of brandy, observing, as he hurried
      away, that he was &ldquo;apt to have spasms in the night&rdquo;; and Sir Moses,
      thinking he was well rid of him at the price, went through the ceremony of
      asking the &ldquo;remanets&rdquo; if they would take any more, and being unanimously
      answered in the negative, he lit the bedroom candles, turned off the <i>modérateurs</i>,
      and left the room to darkness and to Bankhead.

      CHAPTER XXXIV.<br/>GOING TO COVER WITH THE HOUNDS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>OW different a
      place generally proves to what we anticipate, and how difficult it is to
      recall our expectations after we have once seen it, unless we have made a
      memorandum beforehand. How different again a place looks in the morning to
      what we have conjectured over-night. What we have taken for towers perhaps
      have proved to be trees, and the large lake in front a mere floating mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pangbum Park had that loose rakish air peculiar to rented places, which
      carry a sort of visible contest between landlord and tenant on the face of
      everything. A sort of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s you to do it, not me&rdquo; look. It showed a sad
      want of paint and maintenance generally. Sir Moses wasn&rsquo;t the man to do
      anything that wasn&rsquo;t absolutely necessary, &ldquo;Dom&rsquo;d if he was,&rdquo; so inside
      and outside were pretty much alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend Billy Pringle was not a man of much observation in rural
      matters, though he understood the cut of a coat, the tie of a watch-ribbon
      cravat, or the fit of a collar thoroughly. We are sorry to say he had not
      slept very well, having taken too much brandy for conformity&rsquo;s sake, added
      to which his bed was hard and knotty, and the finely drawn bolsters and
      pillows all piled together, were hardly sufficient to raise his throbbing
      temples. As he lay tossing and turning about, thinking now of Clara
      Yammerton&rsquo;s beautiful blue eyes and exquisitely rounded figure, now of
      Flora&rsquo;s bright hair, or Harriet&rsquo;s graceful form, the dread Monsieur
      entered his shabbily furnished bed-room, with, &ldquo;Sare, I have de pleasure
      to bring you your pink to-day,&rdquo; at once banishing the beauties and
      recalling the over-night&rsquo;s conversation, the frightful fences, the yawning
      ditches, the bottomless brooks, with the unanimous declaration that the
      man who could ride over Hit-im and Hold-im-shire could ride over any
      country in the world. And Billy really thought if he could get over the
      horrors of that day he would retire from the purgatorial pleasures of the
      chace altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>
      With this wise resolution he jumped out of bed with the vigorous
      determination of a man about to take a shower-bath, and proceeded to
      invest himself in the only mitigating features of the chace, the red coat
      and leathers. He was hardly well in them before a clamorous bell rang for
      breakfast, quickly followed by a knock at the door, announcing that it was
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses was always in a deuce of a hurry on a hunting morning. Our hero
      was then presently performing the coming downstairs feat he is represented
      doing at page 147. and on reaching the lower regions he jumped in with a
      dish of fried ham which led him straight to the breakfast room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Sir Moses was doing all things at once, reading the &ldquo;Post,&rdquo; blowing
      his beak, making the tea, stirring the fire, crumpling his envelopes,
      cussing the toast, and doming the footman, to which numerous avocations he
      now added the pleasing one of welcoming our Billv.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done you! First down, I do declare!&rdquo; exclaimed he, tendering him his
      left hand, his right one being occupied with his kerchief. &ldquo;Sit down, and
      let&rsquo;s be at it,&rdquo; continued he, kicking a rush-bottomed chair under Billy
      as it were, adding &ldquo;never wait for any man on a hunting morning.&rdquo; So
      saying, he proceeded to snatch an egg, in doing which he upset the
      cream-jug. &ldquo;Dom the thing,&rdquo; growled he, &ldquo;what the deuce do they set it
      there for. D&rsquo;ye take tea?&rdquo; now asked he, pointing to the tea-pot with his
      knife&mdash;&ldquo;or coffee?&rdquo; continued he, pointing to the coffee-pot with his
      fork, &ldquo;or both praps,&rdquo; added he, without waiting for an answer to either
      question, but pushing both pots towards his guest, following up the
      advance with ham, eggs, honey, buns, butter, bread, toast, jelly,
      everything within reach, until he got Billy fairly blocked with good
      things, when he again set-to on his own account, munching and crunching,
      and ended by nearly dragging all the contents of the table on to the floor
      by catching the cloth with his spur as he got up to go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then went doming and scuttling out of the room, charging Billy if he
      meant to go with the hounds to &ldquo;look sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During his absence Stephen Booty and Mr. Silverthorn came dawdling into
      the room, taking it as easy as men generally do who have their horses on
      and don&rsquo;t care much about hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed Silverthorn never disguised that he would rather have his covers
      under plough than under gorse, and was always talking about the rent he
      lost, which he estimated at two pounds an acre, and Sir Moses at ten
      shillings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the coast clear, they now rang for fresh ham, fresh eggs, fresh
      tea, fresh everything, and then took to pumping Billy as to his connection
      with the house, Sir Moses having made him out over night to be a son of
      Sir Jonathan Pringle&rsquo;s, with whom he sometimes claimed cousinship, and
      they wanted to get a peep at the baronetage if they could. In the midst of
      their subtle examination, Sir Moses came hurrying back, whip in one hand,
      hat in the other, throwing open the door, with, &ldquo;Now, are you ready?&rdquo; to
      Billy, and &ldquo;morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; to Booty and Silverthorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Billy rose with the desperate energy of a man going to a dentist&rsquo;s,
      and seizing his cap and whip off the entrance table, followed Sir Moses
      through the intricacies of the back passages leading to the stables,
      nearly falling over a coal-scuttle as he went. They presently changed the
      tunnel-like darkness of the passage into the garish light of day, by the
      opening of the dirty back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Descending the little flight of stone steps, they then entered the
      stable-yard, now enlivened with red coats and the usual concomitants of
      hounds leaving home. There was then an increased commotion, stable-doors
      flying open, from which arch-necked horses emerged, pottering and feeling
      for their legs as they went. Off the cobble-stone pavement, and on to the
      grass grown soft of the centre, they stood more firm and unflinching. Then
      Sir Moses took one horse, Tom Findlater another, Harry the first whip a
      third, Joe the second whip a fourth, while the blue-coated pad groom came
      trotting round on foot from the back stables, between Sir Moses&rsquo;s second
      horse and Napoleon the Great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy dived at his horse without look or observation, and the clang of
      departure being now at its height, the sash of a second-floor window flew
      up, and a white cotton night-capped head appeared bellowing out, &ldquo;<i>Y-o-i-cks
      wind &lsquo;im! y-o-i-cks push &lsquo;im up!</i>&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;<i>Didn&rsquo;t I tell ye</i> it
      was going to be a hunting morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, Cuddy you did,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses laughing, muttering as he went:
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the extent of your doings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be late, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked Billy, spurring up alongside of the
      Baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s only an afternoon sportsman that,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses; adding,
      &ldquo;he&rsquo;s greatest after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; mused Billy, who had looked upon him with the respect due to a
      regular flyer, a man who could ride over Hit-im and Hold-im-shire itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverie was presently interrupted by the throwing open of the kennel
      door, and the clamorous rush of the glad pack to the advancing red coats,
      making the green sward look quite gay and joyful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently, there! gently!&rdquo; cried Tom Findlater, and first and second whips
      falling into places, Tom gathered his horse together and trotted briskly
      along the side of the ill-kept carriage road, and on through the
      dilapidated lodges: a tattered hat protruding through the window of one,
      and two brown paper panes supplying the place of glass in the other. They
      then got upon the high road, and the firy edge being taken off both hounds
      and horses, Tom relaxed into the old post-boy pace, while Sir Moses
      proceeded to interrogate him as to the state of the kennel generally, how
      Rachael&rsquo;s feet were, whether Prosperous was any better, if Abelard had
      found his way home, and when Sultan would be fit to come out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They then got upon other topics connected with the chace, such as, who the
      man was that Harry saw shooting in Tinklerfield cover; if Mrs Swan had
      said anything more about her confounded poultry; and whether Ned Smith the
      rat-catcher would take half a sovereign for his terrier or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having at length got all he could out of Tom, Sir Moses then let the
      hounds flow past him, while he held back for our Billy to come up. They
      were presently trotting along together a little in the rear of Joe, the
      second whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve surely seen that horse before,&rdquo; at length observed Sir Moses, after
      a prolonged stare at our friend&rsquo;s steed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; replied Billy, &ldquo;I bought him of the Major.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce you did!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, &ldquo;then that&rsquo;s the horse young
      Tabberton had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you know him, do you?&rdquo; asked Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know him! I should think so,&rdquo; rejoined Moses; &ldquo;everybody knows him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; observed Billy, wondering whether for good or evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say, now, the Major would make you give thirty, or five-and-thirty
      pounds for that horse,&rdquo; observed Sir Moses, after another good stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far more!&rdquo; replied Billy, gaily, who was rather proud of having given a
      hundred guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far more!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses with energy; &ldquo;far more! Ah!&rdquo; added he,
      with a significant shake of the head, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s an excellent man, the Major&mdash;an
      excellent man,&mdash;but a <i>leet</i>le too keen in the matter of
      horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just at this critical moment Tommy Heslop of Hawthorndean, who had been
      holding back in Crow-Tree Lane to let the hounds pass, now emerged from
      his halting-place with a &ldquo;Good morning, Sir Moses, here&rsquo;s a fine hunting
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Tommy, good morning,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, extending his
      right hand; for Tommy was a five-and-twenty pounder besides giving a
      cover, and of course was deserving of every encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The salute over, Sir Moses then introduced our friend Billy,&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
      Pringle, a Featherbedfordshire gentleman, Mr. Heslop,&rdquo; which immediately
      excited Tommy&rsquo;s curiosity&mdash;not to say jealousy&mdash;for the &ldquo;Billet&rdquo;
       was very &ldquo;contagious,&rdquo; for several of the Peer&rsquo;s men, who always brought
      their best horses, and did as much mischief as they could, and after ever
      so good a run, declared it was nothing to talk of. Tommy thought Billy&rsquo;s
      horse would not take much cutting down, whatever the rider might do.
      Indeed, the good steed looked anything but formidable, showing that a bad
      stable, though &ldquo;only for one night,&rdquo; may have a considerable effect upon a
      horse. His coat was dull and henfeathered; his eye was watery, and after
      several premonitory sneezes, he at length mastered a cough. Even Billy
      thought he felt rather less of a horse under him than he liked. Still he
      didn&rsquo;t think much of a cough. &ldquo;Only a slight cold,&rdquo; as a young lady says
      when she wants to go to a ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three horsemen in front, two black coats and a red, and two reds joining
      the turnpike from the Witch berry road, increased the cavalcade and
      exercised Sir Moses&rsquo; ingenuity in appropriating backs and boots and
      horses. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Simon Smith,&rdquo; said he to himself, eyeing a pair of
      desperately black tops dangling below a very plumb-coloured, long-backed,
      short-lapped jacket. &ldquo;Ah! and Tristram Wood,&rdquo; added he, now recognising
      his companion. He then drew gradually upon them and returned their salutes
      with an extended wave of the hand that didn&rsquo;t look at all like money. Sir
      Moses then commenced speculating on the foremost group. There was Peter
      Linch and Charley Drew; but who was the fellow in black? He couldn&rsquo;t make
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the man in black, Tommy?&rdquo; at length asked he of Tommy Heslop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Tommy, after scanning the stranger attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be that nasty young Rowley Abingdon; and yet I believe it is,&rdquo;
       continued Sir Moses, eyeing him attentively, and seeing that he did not
      belong to the red couple, who evidently kept aloof from him. &ldquo;It is that
      nasty young Abingdon,&rdquo; added he. &ldquo;Wonder at his impittance in coming out
      with me. It&rsquo;s only the other day that ugly old Owl of a father of his
      killed me young Cherisher, the best hound in my pack,&rdquo; whereupon the
      Baronet began grinding his teeth, and brewing a little politeness
      wherewith to bespatter the young Owl as he passed. The foremost horses
      hanging back to let their friends the hounds overtake them, Sir Moses was
      presently alongside the black coat, and finding he was right in his
      conjecture as to who it contained, he returned the youth&rsquo;s awkward salute
      with, &ldquo;Well, my man, how d&rsquo;ye do? hope you&rsquo;re well. How&rsquo;s your father?
      hope he&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;dom &lsquo;im, he should be hung, and you may tell &lsquo;im
      I said so.&rdquo; Sir Moses then felt his horse gently with his heel, and
      trotted on to salute the red couple. And thus he passed from singles to
      doubles, and from doubles to triples, and from triples to quartets, and
      back to singles again, including the untold occupants of various vehicles,
      until the ninth milestone on the Bushmead road, announced their approach
      to the Crooked Billet. Tom Findlater then pulled up from the postboy jog
      into a wallk, at which pace he turned into the little green field on the
      left of the blue and gold swinging sign. Here he was received by the
      earthstopper, the antediluvian ostler, and other great officers of state.
      But for Sir Moses&rsquo; presence the question would then have been &ldquo;What will
      you have to drink?&rdquo; That however being interdicted, they raised a
      discussion about the weather, one insisting that it was going to be a
      frost; another, that it was going to be nothing of the sort.

      CHAPTER XXXV.<br/>THE MEET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Crooked Billet
      Hotel and Posting house, on the Bushmead road had been severed from
      society by the Crumpletin Railway. It had indeed been cut off in the prime
      of life: for Joe Cherriper, the velvet-collared doeskin-gloved Jehu of the
      fast Regulator Coach, had backed his opinion of the preference of the
      public for horse transit over steam, by laying out several hundred pounds
      of his accumulated fees upon the premises, just as the surveyors were
      setting out the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rally might be andy enough for goods and eavy marchandise,&rdquo; Joe said;
      &ldquo;but as to gents ever travellin&rsquo; by sich contraband means, that was
      utterly and entirely out of the question. Never would appen so long as
      there was a well-appointed coach like the Regulator to be ad.&rdquo; So Joe laid
      on the green paint and the white paint, and furbished up the sign until it
      glittered resplendent in the rays of the mid-day sun. But greater prophets
      than Joe have been mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fine summer&rsquo;s afternoon a snorting steam-engine came puffing and
      panting through the country upon a private road of its own, drawing after
      it the accumulated rank, beauty, and fashion of a wide district to open
      the railway, which presently sucked up all the trade and traffic of the
      country. The Crooked Billet fell from a first-class way-side house at
      which eight coaches changed horses twice a-day, into a very seedy
      unfrequented place&mdash;a very different one to what it was when our
      hero&rsquo;s mother, then Miss Willing, changed horses on travelling up in the
      Old True Blue Independent, on the auspicious day that she captured Mr.
      Pringle. Still it was visited with occasional glimpses of its former
      greatness in the way of the meets of the hounds, when the stables were
      filled, and the long-deserted rooms rang with the revelry of visitors.
      This was its first gala-day of the season, and several of the
      Featherbedfordshire gentlemen availed themselves of the fineness of the
      weather to see Sir Moses&rsquo; hounds, and try whether they, too, could ride
      over Hit-im and Hold-im shire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hounds had scarcely had their roll on the greensward, and old black
      Challenger proclaimed their arrival with his usual deep-toned vehemence,
      ere all the converging roads and lanes began pouring in their tributaries,
      and the space before the bay-windowed red brick-built &ldquo;Billet&rdquo; was soon
      blocked with gentlemen on horseback, gentlemen in Malvern dog-carts,
      gentlemen in Newport Pagnells, gentlemen in Croydon clothesbaskets, some
      divesting themselves of their wraps, some stretching themselves after
      their drive, some calling for brandy, some for baccy, some for both brandy
      and baccy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed the usual inquiries, &ldquo;Is Dobbinson coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Damper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anybody seen anything of Gameboy Green?&rdquo; Next, the heavily laden
      family vehicles began to arrive, containing old fat <i>paterfamilias</i>
      in the red coat of his youth, with his &ldquo;missis&rdquo; by his side, and a couple
      of buxom daughters behind, one of whom will be installed in the driving
      seat when papa resigns. Thus we have the Mellows of Mawdsley Hill, the
      Chalkers of Streetley, and the Richleys of Jollyduck Park, and the cry is
      still, &ldquo;They come! they come!&rdquo; It is going to be a bumper meet, for the
      foxes are famous, and the sight of a good &ldquo;get away&rdquo; is worth a dozen
      Legers put together.
    </p>
    <p>
      See here comes a nice quiet-looking little old gentleman in a
      well-brushed, flat-brimmed hat, a bird&rsquo;s-eye cravat, a dark grey coat
      buttoned over a step-collared toilanette vest, nearly matching in line his
      delicate cream-coloured leathers, who everybody stares at and then
      salutes, as he lifts first one rose-tinted top and then the other, working
      his way through the crowd, on a thorough-bred snaffle-bridled bay. He now
      makes up to Sir Moses, who exclaims as the raised hat shows the familiar
      blue-eyed face, &ldquo;Ah! Dicky my man! how d&rsquo;ye do? glad to see you?&rdquo; and
      taking off his glove the Baronet gives our old friend Boggledike a hearty
      shake of the hand. Dicky acknowledges the honour with becoming reverence,
      and then begins talking of sport and the splendid runs they have been
      having, while Sir Moses, instead of listening, cons over some to give him
      in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who have we here sitting so square in the tandem-like dogcart, drawn
      by the high-stepping, white-legged bay with sky-blue rosettes, and long
      streamers, doing the pride that apes humility in a white Macintosh, that
      shows the pink collar to great advantage? Imperial John, we do believe?
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperial John, it is! He has come all the way from Barley Hill Hall,
      leaving the people on the farm and the plate in the drawing-room to take
      care of themselves, starting before daylight, while his footman groom has
      lain out over night to the serious detriment of a half sovereign. As John
      now pulls up, with a trace-rattling ring, he cocks his Imperial chin and
      looks round for applause&mdash;a &ldquo;Well done, you!&rdquo; or something of that
      sort, for coming such a distance. Instead of that, a line of winks, and
      nods, and nudges, follow his course, one man whispering another, &ldquo;I say,
      here&rsquo;s old Imperial John,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I say, look at Miss de Glancey&rsquo;s boy;&rdquo;
       while the young ladies turn their eyes languidly upon him to see what sort
      of a hero the would-be Benedict is. His Highness, however, has quite got
      over his de Glancey failure, and having wormed his way after divers &ldquo;with
      your leaves,&rdquo; and &ldquo;by your leaves,&rdquo; through the intricacies of the crowd,
      he now pulls up at the inn door, and standing erect in his dog-cart,
      sticks his whip in the socket, and looks around with a &ldquo;This is Mr. Hybrid
      the-friend-of-an-Earl&rdquo; sort of air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Hybrid, how d&rsquo;ye do?&rdquo; now exclaims Sir Moses familiarly; &ldquo;hope you&rsquo;re
      well?&mdash;how&rsquo;s the Peer? hope he&rsquo;s well. Come all the way from Barley
      Hill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barley Hill <i>Hall</i>,&rdquo; replies the great man with an emphasis on the
      Hall, adding in the same breath, &ldquo;Oi say, ostler, send moy fellow!&rdquo;
       whereupon there is a renewed nudging and whispering among the ladies
      beside him, of &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mr. Hybrid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Imperial John, the gentleman who wanted to marry Miss de Glancey
      for though Miss de Glancey was far above having him, she was not above
      proclaiming the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His Highness then becomes an object of inquisitive scrutiny by the fair;
      one thinking he might do for Lavinia Edwards; another, for Sarah Bates; a
      third, for Rachel Bell; a fourth, perhaps, for herself. It must be a poor
      creature that isn&rsquo;t booked for somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, John stands erect in his vehicle, flourishing his whip, hallooing
      and asking for his fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring the bell for moy fellow!&mdash;Do go for moy fellow!&mdash;Has
      anybody seen moy fellow? Have you seen moy fellow?&rdquo; addressing an old
      smock-frocked countryman with a hoe in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor, arm d&mdash;d if iver ar i did!&rdquo; replied the veteran, looking him
      over, a declaration that elicited a burst of laughter from the bystanders,
      and an indignant chuck of the Imperial chin from our John.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tweet, tweet, tweet!</i>&rdquo; who have we here? All eyes turn up the
      Cherryburn road; the roused hounds prick their ears, and are with
      difficulty restrained from breaking away. It&rsquo;s Walker, the cross postman&rsquo;s
      gig, and he is treating himself to a twang of the horn. But who has he
      with him? Who is the red arm-folded man lolling with as much dignity as
      the contracted nature of the vehicle will allow? A man in red, with cap
      and beard, and all complete. Why it&rsquo;s Monsieur! Monsieur coming <i>in
      forma pauperis</i>, after Sir Moses&rsquo; liberal offer to send him to cover,&mdash;Monsieur
      in a faded old sugar-loaf shaped cap, and a scanty coat that would have
      been black if it hadn&rsquo;t been red.
    </p>

    <h4>

    </h4>
    <p>
      Still Walker trots him up like a man proud of his load amid the suppressed
      titters and &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; of the company. Sir Moses immediately vouchsafes
      him protection&mdash;by standing erect in his stirrups, and exclaiming
      with a waive of his right hand, &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur! <i>comment vous
      portez-vous?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty bobbish, I tenk you, sare, opes you are vell yourself and all de
      leetle Mainchanees,&rdquo; replied Monsieur, rising in the gig, showing the
      scrimpness of his coat and the amplitude of his cinnamon-coloured peg-top
      trousers, thrust into green-topped opera-boots, much in the style of old
      Paul Pry. Having put something into Walker&rsquo;s hand, Monsieur alights with
      due caution and Walker whipping on, presently shows the gilt &ldquo;V. R.&rdquo; on
      the back of his red gig as he works his way through the separating crowd.
      Walker claims to be one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s servants; if not to rank next to
      Lord Palmerston, at all events not to be far below him. And now Monsieur
      being left to himself, thrusts his Malacca cane whip stick under his arm,
      and drawing on a pair of half-dirty primrose-coloured kid gloves, pokes
      into the crowd in search of his horse, making up to every disengaged one
      he saw, with &ldquo;Is dee&rsquo;s for me? Is dee&rsquo;s for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Imperial John having emancipated himself from his Mackintosh,
      and had his horse placed becomingly at the step of the dog-cart, so as to
      transfer himself without alighting, and let everybody see the magnificence
      of the establishment, now souces himself into the saddle of a fairish
      young grey, and turns round to confront the united field; feeling by no
      means the smallest man in the scene. &ldquo;Hybrid!&rdquo; exclaims Sir Moses, seeing
      him approach the still dismounted Monsieur, &ldquo;Hybrid! let me introduce my
      friend Rougier, Monsieur Rougier, Mr. Hybrid! of Barley Hill Hall, a great
      friend of Lord Ladythorne&rsquo;s,&rdquo; whereupon off went the faded
      sugar-loaf-shaped cap, and down came the Imperial hat, Sir Moses
      interlarding the ceremony with, &ldquo;great friend of Louis Nap&rsquo;s, great friend
      of Louis Nap&rsquo;s,&rdquo; by way of balancing the Ladythorne recommendation of
      John. The two then struck up a most energetic conversation, each being
      uncommonly taken with the other. John almost fancied he saw his way to the
      Tuileries, and wondered what Miss &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; would say if he got there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was at length interrupted by Dribbler&rsquo;s grinning groom
      touching Jack behind as he came up with a chestnut horse, and saying,
      &ldquo;Please, Sir, here&rsquo;s your screw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my screw, is it!&rdquo; replied Jack, turning round, &ldquo;dat is a queer name
      for a horse&mdash;screw&mdash;hopes he&rsquo;s a good &lsquo;un.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good &lsquo;un, and nothin&rsquo; but a good &lsquo;un,&rdquo; replied the groom, giving him a
      punch in the ribs, to make him form up to Jack, an operation that produced
      an ominous grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell&rdquo; said Jack, proceeding to dive at the stirrup with his foot without
      taking hold of the reins; &ldquo;if Screw is a good &lsquo;un I sall make you handsome
      present&mdash;tuppence a penny, p&rsquo;raps&mdash;if he&rsquo;s a bad &lsquo;un, I sall
      give you good crack on the skoll,&rdquo; Jack flourishing his thick whipstick as
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you!&rdquo; replied the man, leaving go of the rein, whereupon down went
      the horse&rsquo;s head, up went his heels, and Jack was presently on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, de devil!&rdquo; roared Jack, &ldquo;he vill distribute me! he vill distribute
      me! I vill be killed! Nobody sall save me! here, garçon, grum!&rdquo; roared he
      amid the mirth of the company. &ldquo;Lay &lsquo;old of his &lsquo;ead! lay &lsquo;old of his
      &lsquo;ocks! lay &lsquo;old of &lsquo;eels! Oh, murder! murder!&rdquo; continued he in
      well-feigned dismay, throwing out his supplicating arms. Off jumped
      Imperial John to the rescue of his friend, and seizing the dangling rein,
      chucked up the horse&rsquo;s head with a resolute jerk that restored Jack to his
      seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my friend, I see you are not much used to the saddle,&rdquo; observed His
      Highness, proceeding to console the friend of an Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, sare, I am, and I am not,&rdquo; replied Jack, mopping his brow, and
      pretending to regain his composure, &ldquo;I am used to de leetle &lsquo;orse at de
      round-about at de fair, I can carry off de ring ten time out of twice, but
      these great unruly, unmannerly, undutiful screws are more than a match for
      old Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; assented His Highness, with a chuck of his Imperial chin, &ldquo;just
      so;&rdquo; adding in an under-tone, &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      tell you what we&rsquo;ll do&mdash;we&rsquo;ll pop into the bar at the back of the
      house, and have a glass of something to strengthen our nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, sare,&rdquo; replied Jack, who was always ready for a glass. So
      they quietly turned the corner, leaving the field to settle their risible
      faculties, while they summoned the pretty corkscrew ringletted Miss Tubbs
      to their behests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall it be?&rdquo; asked Imperial John, as the smiling young lady tripped
      down the steps to where they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brandy,&rdquo; replied Jack, with a good English accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two brandies!&rdquo; demanded Imperial John, with an air of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold, <i>with</i>?&rdquo; asked the lady, eyeing Monsieur&rsquo;s grim visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Neat!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Jack in a tone of disdain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir,&rdquo; assented the lady, bustling away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Shilling</i> glasses!&rdquo; roared Jack, at the last flounce of her blue
      muslin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she returned bearing two glasses of very brown brandy, and each
      having appropriated one, Jack began grinning and bowing and complimenting
      the donor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sare,&rdquo; said he, after smelling at the beloved liquor, &ldquo;I have moch
      pleasure in making your quaintance. I am moch pleased, sare, with the
      expression of your mog. I tink, sare, you are de &lsquo;andsomest man I never
      had de pleasure of lookin&rsquo; at. If, sare, dey had you in my country, sare,
      dey vod make you a King&mdash;Emperor, I mean. I drink, sare, your vare
      good health,&rdquo; so saying, Jack swigged off the contents of his glass at a
      draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperial John felt constrained to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better now,&rdquo; observed Jack, rubbing his stomach as the liquid fire began
      to descend. &ldquo;Better now,&rdquo; repeated he, with a jerk of his head, &ldquo;Sare,&rdquo;
       continued he, &ldquo;I sall return the compliment&mdash;I sall treat you to a
      glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Imperial John would rather not. He was a glass of sherry and a biscuit
      sort of man; but Monsieur was not to be balked in his liberality. &ldquo;Oh,
      yes, sare, make me de pleasure to accept a glass,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;Here!
      Jemima! Matilda! Adelaide! vot the doose do they call de young vomans&mdash;look
      sharp,&rdquo; added he, as she now reappeared. &ldquo;Apportez, dat is to say, bring
      tout suite, directly; two more glasses; dis gentlemans vill be goode
      enough to drink my vare good &lsquo;ealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the smiling lady, tripping away for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, sare, it is de stoff to make de air corl,&rdquo; observed Jack, eyeing his
      new acquaintance. &ldquo;Ye sall go like old chaff before the vind after it.
      Vill catch de fox myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first glass had nearly upset our Imperial friend, and the second one
      appeared perfectly nauseous. He would give anything that Jack would drink
      them both himself. However, Monsieur motioned blue muslin to present the
      tray to John first, so he had no alternative but to accept. Jack then took
      his glass, and smacking his lips, said&mdash;&ldquo;I looks, sare, towards you,
      sare, vith all de respect due to your immortal country. De English, sare,
      are de finest nation under de moon; and you, sare, and you are as fine a
      specimens of dat nation as never vas seen. Two such mans as you, sare,
      could have taken Sebastopol. You could vop all de ell ound savage Sepoys
      by yourself. So now, sare,&rdquo; continued Jack, brandishing his glass, &ldquo;make
      ready, present, <i>fire!</i>&rdquo; and at the word fire, he drained off his
      glass, and then held it upside down to show he had emptied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Imperial John was obliged to follow suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Imperial head now began to swim. Mr. Hybrid saw two girls in blue
      muslin, two Monsieurs, two old yellow Po-chaises, two water-carts with a
      Cochin-China cock a gollowing a-top of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, on the contrary, was quite comfortable. He had got his nerves
      strung, and was now ready for anything. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose, now,&rdquo; said he, addressing
      his staring, half-bewildered friend, &ldquo;you ascend your gallant grey, and
      let us look after dese mighty chasseurs. But stop,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;I vill
      first pay for de tipple,&rdquo; pretending to dive into his peg-top trousers
      pocket for his purse. &ldquo;<i>Ah! malheureusement</i>,&rdquo; exclaimed he, after
      feeling them both. &ldquo;I have left my blont, my tin, in my oder trousers
      pockets. Navare mind! navare mind,&rdquo; continued he, gaily, &ldquo;ve vill square
      it op some other day. Here,&rdquo; added he to the damsel, &ldquo;dis gentlemens vill
      pay, and I vill settle vid him some oder day&mdash;some oder day.&rdquo; So
      saying, Jack gathered his horse boldly together, and spurred out of the
      inn-yard in a masterly way, singing <i>Partant pour la Syrie</i> as he
      went.

    <p>
      HE friends reappeared at the front of the Crooked Billet Hotel when the
      whole cavalcade had swept away, leaving only the return ladies, and such
      of the grooms as meant to have a drink, now that &ldquo;master was safe.&rdquo; Sir
      Moses had not paid either Louis Napoleon&rsquo;s or Lord Ladythorne&rsquo;s friend
      the compliment of waiting for them. On the contrary, having hailed the
      last heavy subscriber who was in the habit of using the Crooked Billet
      meet, he hallooed the huntsman to trot briskly away down Rickleton Lane,
      and across Beecham pastures, as well to shake off the foot-people, as to
      prevent any attempted attendance on the part of the carriage company. Sir
      Moses, though very gallant, was not always in the chattering mood; and,
      assuredly, if ever a master of hounds may be excused for a little
      abruptness, it is when he is tormented by the rival spirits of the
      adjoining hunt, people who always see things so differently to the men of
      the country, so differently to what they are meant to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident however by the lingering looks and position of parties that
      the hunt had not been long gone&mdash;indeed, the last red coat might
      still be seen bobbing up and down past the weak and low parts of the
      Rickleton Lane fence. So Monsieur, having effected a satisfactory
      rounding, sot his horse&rsquo;s head that way, much in the old threepence a-mile
      and hopes for something over, style of his youth. Jack hadn&rsquo;t forgotten
      how to ride, though he might occasionally find it convenient to pretend to
      be a tailor. Indeed, his horse seemed to have ascertained the fact, and
      instead of playing any more monkey-tricks, he began to apply himself
      sedulously to the road. Imperial John was now a fitter subject for
      solicitude than Monsieur, His Highness&rsquo;s usual bumptious bolt-upright seat
      being exchanged for a very slouchy, vulgar roll. His saucy eyes too seemed
      dim and dazzled, like an owl&rsquo;s flying against the sun. Some of the toiling
      pedestrians, who in spite of Sir Moses&rsquo;s intention to leave them in the
      lurch, had started for the hunt, were the first overtaken, next two
      grinning boys riding a barebacked donkey, one with his face to the tail,
      doing the flagellation with an old hearth-brush, then a brandy-nosed
      horse-breaker, with a badly-grown black colt that didn&rsquo;t promise to be
      good for anything, next Dr. Linton on his dun pony, working his arms and
      legs most energetically, riding far faster than his nag; next Noggin, the
      exciseman, stealing quietly along on his mule as though he were bent on
      his business and had no idea of a hunt; and at length a more legitimate
      representative of the chace in the shape of young Mr. Hadaway, of
      Oakharrow Hill, in a pair of very baggy white cords, on but indifferent
      terms about the knees with his badly cleaned tops. They did not, however,
      overtake the hounds, and the great body of scarlet, till just as they
      turned off the Summersham road into an old pasture-field, some five acres
      of the low end of which had been cut off for a gorse to lay to the
      adjoining range of rocky hills whose rugged juniper and broom-dotted sides
      afforded very comfortable and popular lying for the foxes. It being, if a
      find, a quick &ldquo;get away,&rdquo; all hands were too busy thinking of themselves
      and their horses, and looking for their usual opponents to take heed of
      anything else, and Jack and his friends entered without so much as an
      observation from any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment up went Joe&rsquo;s cap on the top of the craig, and the
      scene changed to one of universal excitement. Then, indeed, had come the
      tug of war! Sir Moses, all hilarity, views the fox! Now Stephen Booty sees
      him, now Peter Lynch, and now a whole cluster of hats are off in his
      honour.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ****
    </h3>
    <p>
      And now his honour&rsquo;s off himself&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Shrill horns proclaim his flight.&rdquo;
 Oh dear! oh dear! where&rsquo;s Billy Pringle?
Oh dear! oh dear! where&rsquo;s Imperial John?
Oh dear! where&rsquo;s Jack Rogers?
</pre>
    <p>
      Jack&rsquo;s all right! There he is grinning with enthusiasm, quite forgetting
      that he&rsquo;s a Frenchman, and hoisting his brown cap with the best of them.
      Another glass would have made him give a stunning view-halloa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperial John stares like a man just awoke from a dream. Is he in bed, or
      is he out hunting, or how! he even thinks he hears Miss de Glancey&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Si-r-r!</i>
      do you mean to insult me?&rdquo; ringing in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Pringle! poor Billy! he&rsquo;s not so unhappy as usual. His horse is very
      docile. His tail has lost all its elegant gaiety, and altogether he has a
      very drooping, weedy look: he coughs, too, occasionally. Billy, however,
      doesn&rsquo;t care about the coughs, and gives him a dig with his spur to stop
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Mr. Pringle, come along!&rdquo; now shrieks Sir Moses, hurrying
      past, hands down, head too, hugging and spurring his horse as he goes. He
      is presently through the separating throng, leaving Billy far in the rear.
      &ldquo;<i>Quick&rsquo;s</i>&rdquo; the word, or the chance is lost. There are no reserved
      places at a hunt. A flying fox admits of no delay. It is either go or
      stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, Monsieur Jean Rougier having stuck his berry-brown conical cap
      tight on his bristly black head, crams his chestnut horse through the
      crowd, hallooing to his transfixed brandy friend, &ldquo;Come along, old
      cock-a-doodle! come along, old Blink Bonny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Imperial John, who has been holding a mental conference with himself,
      poising himself in the saddle, and making a general estimate of his
      condition, thinking he is not so drunk as &ldquo;all that,&rdquo; accepts the familiar
      challenge, and urges his horse on with the now flying crowd. He presently
      makes a bad shot at a gate on the swing, which catching him on the
      kneecap, contributes very materially to restore his sobriety, the pain
      making him first look back for his leg, which he thinks must be off, and
      then forward at the field. It is very large; two bustling Baronets, two
      Monsieurs, two huntsmen, two flying hatters&mdash;everybody in duplicate,
      in short.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away they scud up Thorneycroft Valley at a pace that looks very like
      killing. The foremost rise the hill, hugging and holding on by the manes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; says his Highness to himself, giving up rubbing his kneecap,
      and settling himself in his saddle, he hustles his horse, and pushing past
      the undecided ones, is presently in the thick of the fray. There is Jack
      going, elbows and legs, elbows and legs, at a very galloping, dreary, done
      sort of pace, the roaring animal he bestrides contracting its short,
      leg-tied efforts every movement. Jack presently begins to objurgate the
      ass who lent it him; first wishes he was on himself, then declares the
      tanner ought to have him. He now sits sideways, and proceeds to give him a
      good rib-roasting in the old post-boy style.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now there&rsquo;s a bobbing up and down of hats, caps, and horses&rsquo; heads in
      front, with the usual deviation under the &ldquo;hounds clauses consolidation
      act,&rdquo; where the dangerous fencing begins. A pair of white breeches are
      summersaulting in the air, and a bay horse is seen careering in a wild
      head in the air sort of way, back to the rear instead of following the
      hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky,&rdquo; said Jack Rogers to himself, as soon as he saw him coming
      towards him, and circumventing him adroitly at the corner of a
      turnip-field, he quits his own pumped-out animal and catches him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      good,&rdquo; said he, looking him over, seeing that he was a lively young animal
      in fairish condition, with a good saddle and bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stirrups just my length, too, I do believe,&rdquo; continued he, preparing to
      mount. &ldquo;All right, by Jove!&rdquo; added he, settling himself into the saddle,
      feet well home, and gathering his horse together, he shot forward with the
      easy elasticity of breeding. It was a delightful change from the rolling
      cow-like action of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see vot he as in his monkey,&rdquo; said Jack to himself, now drawing
      the flask from the saddle-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sherry, I fear,&rdquo; said he, uncorking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brandy, I declare,&rdquo; added he with delight, after smelling it. He then
      took a long pull at the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good it is, too!&rdquo; exclaimed he, smacking his lips; &ldquo;better nor ve ad at
      de poblic;&rdquo; so saying, he took another long suck of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May as vell finish it,&rdquo; continued he, shaking it at his ear to ascertain
      what was left; and having secured the remainder, he returned the monkey to
      the saddle-case, and put on his horse with great glee, taking a most
      independent line of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack&rsquo;s triumph, however, was destined to be but of short duration. The fox
      being hard pressed, abandoned his original point for Collington Woods, and
      swerving to the left over Stanbury Hundred, was headed by a cur, and
      compelled to seek safety in a drain in the middle of a fallow field. The
      hounds were presently feathering over the mouth in the usual wild,
      disappointed sort of way, that as good as says, &ldquo;No fault of ours, you
      know; if he won&rsquo;t stay above ground, we can&rsquo;t catch him for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such of the field as had not ridden straight for Collington Woods, were
      soon down at the spot; and while the usual enquiries, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Pepper?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Viper?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where can we get a spade?&rdquo; &ldquo;Does anybody know anything
      about the direction of this drain?&rdquo; were going on, a fat, fair,
      red-coated, flushed-faced pedestrian&mdash;to wit, young Mr. Threadcroft,
      the woolstapler&rsquo;s son of Harden Grange and Hinton, dived into the thick of
      the throng, and making up to Monsieur, exclaimed in an anger-choked voice,
      &ldquo;This (puff) is my (gasp) horse! What the (gasp, puff) devil do you mean
      by riding away with him in this (puff-, gasp) way?&rdquo; the youth mopping his
      brow with a yellow bandanna as he spoke.

      &ldquo;Your oss!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack with the greatest effrontery, &ldquo;on de loose can
      he be your os: I catched him fair! and I&rsquo;ve a right to ride him to de end
      of de run;&rdquo; a claim that elicited the uproarious mirth of the field, who
      all looked upon the young wool-pack, as they called him, as a muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Nonsense!</i>&rdquo; retorted the youth, half frantic with rage. &ldquo;How can
      that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow can dat be,&rdquo; repeated Jack, turning sideways in his saddle, and
      preparing to argue the case, &ldquo;Ow can dat be? Dis hont, sare, I presume,
      sare, is condocted on de principle of de grand hont de Epping, vere every
      mans vot cotched anoder&rsquo;s oss, is entitled to ride him to the end of de

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; again retorted the youth, amidst the renewed laughter of the
      field. &ldquo;We know nothing of Epping hunts here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; of Epping onts here?&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, throwing out his hands with
      well feigned astonishment. &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; of Epping honts here! Vy, de grand
      hont de Epping rules all the oder honts, jost as the grand Clob de Jockey
      at Newmarket rules all oder Jockey Clubs in de kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoot, toot,&rdquo; sneered the fat youth, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have none of yonr jaw. Give me
      my horse, I say, how can he be yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, sare,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;I tells you I cotched &lsquo;im fairly in de
      field. Bot for me he vod have been lost to society&mdash;to de vorld at
      large&mdash;eat up by de loup&mdash;by de volf&mdash;saddle, bridle, and
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the sort!&rdquo; retorted Mr. Treadcroft, indignantly, &ldquo;you had no
      business to touch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur (with energy). I appeal to you, Sare Moses Baronet, de grand
      maître de chien, de master of all de dogs and all de dogs&rsquo; vives, if I
      have not a right to ride &lsquo;im.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m afraid, Monsieur, it&rsquo;s not the law of this country,&rdquo; replied Sir
      Moses, laughing. &ldquo;It may be so in France, perhaps; but tell me, where&rsquo;s
      your own horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur. Pomped out de beggar; had no go in &lsquo;im; left him in a ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses. That&rsquo;s a pity!&mdash;if you&rsquo;d allowed me, I&rsquo;d have sent you a
      good &lsquo;un.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Treadcroft, thus reinforced by Sir Moses&rsquo;s decision, returned to the
      charge with redoubled vigour. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give me up my horse, sir,&rdquo;
       says he, with firmness, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you in charge of the police for
      stealing him.&rdquo; Then
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Conscience, which makes cowards of us all,&rdquo;

      caused Jack to shrink at the recollection of his early indiscretion in the
      horse-stealing line, and instantly resolving not to give Jack Ketch a
      chance of taking any liberties with his neck, he thus addresses Mr.
      Treadcroft:&mdash;

      &ldquo;Sare, if Sare Moses Baronet, de grand maître de chien, do grandmodder of
      all de dogs and all de dogs&rsquo; vives, says it is not a case of catch &lsquo;im and
      keep &lsquo;im &lsquo;cordin&rsquo; to de rules of de grand hont de Epping, I must surrender
      de quadruped, but I most say it is dem un&rsquo;andsome treatment, after I &lsquo;ave
      been at de trouble of catching &lsquo;im.&rdquo; So saying, Jack dropped off on the
      wrong side of the saddle, and giving the horse a slap on his side left his
      owner to take him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tally-ho! there he goes!</i>&rdquo; now exclaimed a dozen voices, as out
      bounced the fox with a flourish of his well tagged brush that looked
      uncommonly defiant. What a commotion he caused! Every man lent a shout
      that seemed to be answered by a fresh effort from the flyer: but still,
      with twenty couple of overpowering animals after him, what chance did
      there seem for his life, especially when they could hunt him by his scent
      after they had lost sight. Every moment, however, improved his
      opportunity, and a friendly turn of the land shutting him out of view, the
      late darting, half-frantic pack were brought to their noses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold hard for <i>one</i>, minute!&rdquo; is the order of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, catch &rsquo;em if you can!&rdquo; is the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away they go in the settled determined way of a second start. The bolt
      taking place on the lower range of the gently swelling Culmington hills,
      that stretch across the north-east side of Hit-im and Hold-im shire, and
      the fox making for the vale below, Monsieur has a good bird&rsquo;s eye view of
      the scramble, without the danger and trouble of partaking of the struggle.
      Getting astride a newly stubbed ash-tree near the vacated drain mouth, he
      thus sits and soliloquises&mdash;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pretty flyer, dat fox&mdash;if
      dey catch &lsquo;im afore he gets to the hills,&rdquo; eyeing a gray range uudulating
      in the distance, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll do well. That Moff of a man,&rdquo; alluding to
      Treadcroft, &ldquo;&lsquo;ill never get there. At all events,&rdquo; chuckled Jack, &ldquo;his
      brandy vont. Dats &lsquo;im! I do believe,&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, &ldquo;off again!&rdquo; as a
      loose horse is now seen careering across a grass field. &ldquo;No; dat is a
      black coat,&rdquo; continued Jack, as the owner now appeared crossing the field
      in pursuit of his horse. &ldquo;Bot dat vill be &lsquo;im! dat vill be friend Moll&rsquo;,&rdquo;
       as a red rider now measures his length on the greensward of a field in the
      rear of the other one; and Jack, taking off his faded cap, waives it
      triumphantly as he distinctly recognises the wild, staring running of his
      late steed. &ldquo;Dash my buttons!&rdquo; exclaims he, working his arms as if he was
      riding, &ldquo;bot if it hadn&rsquo;t been for dat unwarrantable, unchristian-like
      cheek I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; shown those red coats de vay on dat oss, for I do think he
      has de go in him and only vants shovin&rsquo; along.&mdash;Ah Moff&mdash;my
      friend Moff!&rdquo; laughed he, eyeing Treadcroft&rsquo;s vain endeavour to catch his
      horse, &ldquo;you may as vell leave &lsquo;im where he is&mdash;you&rsquo;ll only fatigue
      yourself to no purpose. If you &lsquo;ad &lsquo;im you&rsquo;d be off him again de next
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The telescope of the chace is now drawn out to the last joint, and Jack,
      as he sits, has a fine bird&rsquo;s eye view of the scene. If the hounds go
      rather more like a flock of wild geese than like the horses in the chariot
      of the sun, so do the field, until the diminutive dots, dribbling through
      the vale, look like the line of a projected railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I mistake not,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;dat leetle shiny eel-like ting,&rdquo;
       eyeing a tortuous silvery thread meandering through the vale, &ldquo;is vater,
      and dere vill be some fon by de time dey get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack is right in his conjecture. It is Long Brawlingford brook, with its
      rotten banks and deep eddying pools, describing all sorts of geographical
      singularities in its course through the country, too often inviting
      aspiring strangers to astonish the natives by riding at it, while the
      cautious countrymen rein in as they approach, and, eyeing the hounds, ride
      for a ford at the first splash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack&rsquo;s friend, Blink Bonny, has ridden not amiss, considering his
      condition&mdash;at all events pretty forward, as may be inferred from his
      having twice crossed the Flying Hatter and come in for the spray of his
      censure. But for the fact of his Highness getting his hats of the flyer,
      he would most likely have received the abuse in the bulk. As it was, the
      hatter kept letting it go as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now as the hounds speed over the rich alluvial pastures by the brook,
      occasionally one throwing its tongue, occasionally another, for the scent
      is first-rate and the pace severe, there is a turning of heads, a checking
      of horses, and an evident inclination to diverge. Water is in no request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows the ford?&rdquo; cries Harry Waggett, who always declined extra risk.&mdash;&ldquo;You
      know the ford, Smith?&rdquo; continued he, addressing himself to black tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when I&rsquo;m in a hur-hur-hurry,&rdquo; ejaculates Smith, now fighting with his
      five-year-old bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&rsquo;ill show ye the ford!&rdquo; cries Imperial John, gathering his grey together
      and sending him at a stiff flight of outside slab-made rails which
      separate the field from the pack. This lands His Highness right among the
      tail hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold hard, Mr. Hybrid!&rdquo; now bellows Sir Moses, indignant at the idea of
      a Featherbedfordshire farmer thinking to cut down his gallant field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One minuit! and you may go as hard as iver you like!&rdquo; cries Tom
      Findlater, who now sees the crows hovering over his fox as he scuttles
      away on the opposite side of the brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is then a great yawing of mouths and hauling of heads and renewed
      inquiries for fords.&mdash;You know the ford, Brown? You know the ford,
      Green? <i>Who</i> knows the ford?
    </p>
    <p>
      His Highness, thus snubbed and rebuked on all sides, is put on his mettle,
      and inwardly resolves not to be bullied by these low Hit-im and Hold-im
      shire chaps. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t know what is due to the friend of an Earl, he
      will let them see that he does.&rdquo; So, regardless of their shouts, he shoves
      along with his Imperial chin well in the air, determined to ride at the
      brook&mdash;let those follow who will. He soon has a chance. The fox has
      taken it right in his line, without deviating a yard either way, and
      Wolds-man, and Bluecap, and Ringwood, and Hazard, and Sparkler are soon
      swimming on his track, followed by the body of the screeching,
      vociferating pack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Blink Bonny now takes a confused, wish-I-was-well-over, sort of look
      at the brook, shuddering when he thought how far he was from dry clothes.
      It is however, too late to retreat. At it he goes in a half resolute sort
      of way, and in an instant the Imperial hat and the Imperial horse&rsquo;s head
      are all that appear above water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hoo-ray!</i>&rdquo; cheer some of the unfeeling Hit-im and Hold-im
      shireites, dropping down into the ford a little below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hoo-ray!</i>&rdquo; respond others on the bank, as the Red Otter, as
      Silverthorne calls His Highness, rises hatless to the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, and I&rsquo;ll help you out!&rdquo; shouts Peter Linch, eyeing Mr.
      Hybrid&rsquo;s vain darts first at the hat and then at the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Featherbedfordshire for ever!&rdquo; cries Charley Drew, who doesn&rsquo;t at all
      like Imperial John.
    </p>
    <p>
      And John, who finds the brook not only a great deal wider, but also a
      great deal deeper and colder than he expected, is in such a state of
      confusion that he lands on one side and his horse on the other, so that
      his chance of further distinction is out for the day. And as he stands
      shivering and shaking and emptying his hat, he meditates on the
      vicissitudes of life, the virtues of sobriety, and the rashness of coping
      with a friend of His Imperial brother, Louis Nap. His horse meanwhile
      regales upon grass, regardless of the fast receding field. Thus John is
      left alone in his glory, and we must be indebted to other sources for an
      account of the finish of this day&rsquo;s sport.

      CHAPTER XXXVII.<br/>TWO ACCOUNTS OF A RUN; OR, LOOK ON THIS PICTURE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ONSIEUR Jean
      Rougier having seen the field get small by degrees, if not beautifully
      less, and having viewed the quivering at the brook, thinking the
      entertainment over, now dismounted from his wooden steed, and, giving it a
      crack with his stick, saying it was about as good as his first one,
      proceeded to perform that sorry exploit of retracing his steps through the
      country on foot. Thanks to the influence of civilisation, there is never
      much difficulty now in finding a road; and, Monsieur was soon in one whose
      grassy hoof-marked sides showed it had been ridden down in chase. Walking
      in scarlet is never a very becoming proceeding; but, walking in such a
      scarlet as Jack had on, coupled with such a cap, procured him but little
      respect from the country people, who took him for one of those scarlet
      runners now so common with hounds. One man (a hedger) in answer to his
      question, &ldquo;If he had seen his horse?&rdquo; replied, after a good stare&mdash;&ldquo;Nor&mdash;nor
      nobody else;&rdquo; thinking that the steed was all imaginary, and Jack was
      wanting to show off: another said, &ldquo;Coom, coom, that ill not de; you&rsquo;ve ne
      horse.&rdquo; Altogether, Monsieur did not get much politeness from anyone; so
      he stumped moodily along, venting his spleen as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that attracted his attention was his own pumped-out steed,
      standing with its snaffle-rein thrown over a gate-post; and Jack, having
      had about enough pedestrian exercise, especially considering that he was
      walking in his own boots, now gladly availed himself of the lately
      discarded mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wooay, ye great grunting brute!&rdquo; exclaimed he, going up with an air of
      ownership, taking the rein off the post, and climbing on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely got well under way, ere a clattering of horses&rsquo; hoofs
      behind him, attracted his attention; and, looking back, he saw the
      Collington Woods detachment careering along in the usual wild, staring, <i>which-way?
      which-way?</i> sort of style of men, who have been riding to points, and
      have lost the hounds. In the midst of the flight was his master, on the
      now woe-begone bay; who came coughing, and cutting, and hammer and
      pincering along, in a very ominous sort of way. Billy, on the other hand,
      flattered himself that they were having a very tremendous run, with very
      little risk, and he was disposed to take every advantage of his horse, by
      way of increasing its apparent severity, thinking it would be a fine thing
      to tell his Mamma how he had got through his horse. Monsieur having
      replied to their <i>which ways?</i> with the comfortable assurance &ldquo;that
      they need not trouble themselves any further, the hounds being miles and
      miles away,&rdquo; there was visible satisfaction on the faces of some; while
      others, more knowing, attempted to conceal their delight by lip-curling
      exclamations of &ldquo;What a bore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought <i>you</i> knew the country, Brown.&rdquo; &ldquo;Never follow you again,
      Smith,&rdquo; and so on. They then began asking for the publics. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the
      Red Lion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does anybody know the way to the Barley Mow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far is it to the Dog and Duck at Westpool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat oss of yours sall not be quite vell, I tink, sare,&rdquo; observed Jack to
      his master, after listening to one of its ominous coughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes he is, only a little lazy,&rdquo; replied Billy, giving him a
      refresher, as well with the whip on his shoulder, as with the spur on his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is feeble, I should say, sare,&rdquo; continued Jack, eyeing him pottering
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I give him, then?&rdquo; asked Billy, thinking there might be
      something in what Jack said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sud say a leetle gin vod be de best ting for im,&rdquo; replied Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gin! but where can I get gin here?&rdquo; asked Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dese gentlemens is asking their vays to de Poblic ouses,&rdquo; replied Jack;
      &ldquo;and if you follows dem, you vill laud at some tap before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack was right. Balmey Zephyr, as they call Billy West, the surgeon of
      Hackthorn, who had joined the hunt quite promiscuous, is leading the way
      to the Red Lion, and the cavalcade is presently before the well-frequented
      door; one man calling for Purl, another Ale, a third for Porter; while
      others hank their horses on to the crook at the door, while they go in to
      make themselves comfortable. Jack dismounting, and giving his horse in
      charge of his master, entered the little way-side hostelry; and, asking
      for a measure of gin, and a bottle of water, he drinks off the gin, and
      then proceeds to rinse Billy&rsquo;s horse&rsquo;s mouth out with the water, just as a
      training-groom rinses a horse&rsquo;s after a race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dat vill do,&rdquo; at length said Jack, chucking the horse&rsquo;s head up in the
      air, as if he gets him to swallow the last drop of the precious beverage.
      &ldquo;Dat vill do,&rdquo; repeated he, adding, &ldquo;he vill now carry you ome like a
      larkspur.&rdquo; So saying, Jack handed the bottle back through the window, and,
      paying the charge, remounted his steed, kissing his hand, and <i>bon-jouring</i>
      the party, as he set off with his master in search of Pangburn Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them being great hands at finding their way about a country,
      they made sundry bad hits, and superfluous deviations, and just reached
      Pangburn Park as Sir Moses and Co. came triumphantly down Rossington hill,
      flourishing the brush that had given them a splendid fifty minutes (ten
      off for exaggeration) without a check, over the cream of their country,
      bringing Imperial John, Gameboy Green, and the flower of the
      Featherbedfordshire hunt, to the most abject and unmitigated grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, such a run!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, throwing out his paws. &ldquo;Oh, such a
      run! Finest run that ever was seen! Sort of run, that if old Thorne
      (meaning Lord Ladythorne) had had, he&rsquo;d have talked about it for a year.&rdquo;
       Sir Moses then descended to particulars, describing the heads up and
      sterns down work to the brook, the Imperial catastrophe which he dwelt
      upon with great <i>goût</i>, dom&rsquo;d if he didn&rsquo;t; and how, leaving John in
      the water, they went away over Rillington Marsh, at a pace that was
      perfectly appalling, every field choking off some of those
      Featherbedfordshireites, who came out thinking to cut them all down; then
      up Tewey Hill, nearly to the crow trees, swinging down again into the vale
      by Billy Mill, skirting Laureston Plantations, and over those splendid
      pastures of Arlingford, where there was a momentary check, owing to some
      coursers, who ought to be hung, dom&rsquo;d if they shouldn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; continued
      Sir Moses, &ldquo;let in some of the laggers, Dickey among the number; but we
      were speedily away again; and, passing a little to the west of Pickering
      Park, through the decoy, and away over Larkington Rise, shot down to the
      Farthing-pie House, where that great Owl, Gameboy Green, thinking to show
      off, rode at an impracticable fence, and got a cropper for his pains,
      nearly knocking the poor little Damper into the middle of the week after
      next by crossing him. Well, from there he made for the main earths in
      Purdoe Banks, where, of course, there was no shelter for him; and,
      breaking at the east end of the dene, he set his head straight for Brace
      well Woods, good two miles off (one and a quarter, say); but his strength
      failing him over Winterflood Heath, we ran from scent to view, in the
      finest, openest manner imaginable,&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; concluded
      Sir Moses, having talked himself out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening, just as Oliver Armstrong was shutting up day by trimming
      and lighting the oil-lamp at the Lockingford toll-bar, which stands within
      a few yards from where the apparently well-behaved little stream of Long
      Brawlingford brook divides the far-famed Hit-im and Hold-im shire from
      Featherbedfordshire, a pair of desperately mud-stained cords below a black
      coat and vest, reined up behind a well wrapped and buttoned-up gentleman
      in a buggy, who chanced to be passing, and drew forth the usual inquiry of
      &ldquo;What sport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The questioner was no less a personage than Mr. Easylease, Lord
      Ladythorne&rsquo;s agent&mdash;we beg pardon, Commissioner&mdash;and Mr. Gameboy
      Green, the tenant in possession of the soiled cords, recognising the voice
      in spite of the wraps, thus replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Easylease it&rsquo;s you, sir, is it? Hope you&rsquo;re well, sir,&rdquo; with a
      sort of move of his hat&mdash;not a take off, nor yet a keep on&mdash;&ldquo;hope
      Mrs. Easylease is quite well, and the young ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite well, thank you; hope Mrs. G.&lsquo;s the same. What sport have you had?&rdquo;
       added the Commissioner, without waiting for an answer to the inquiry about
      the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sport!&rdquo; repeated Gameboy, drawing his breath, as he conned the matter
      hastily over. &ldquo;Sport!&rdquo; recollecting he was as good as addressing the Earl
      himself&mdash;master of hounds&mdash;favours past&mdash;hopes for future,
      and so on. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, seeing his line; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a nice-ish run&mdash;a
      fair-ish day&mdash;five and twenty minutes, or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fast?&rdquo; asked Mr. Easylease, twirling his gig-whip about, for he was going
      to Tantivy Castle in the morning, and thought he might as well have
      something to talk about beside the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middlin&rsquo;&mdash;nothin&rsquo; partieklar,&rdquo; replied Green, with a chuck of the
      chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill?&rdquo; asked the Commissioner, continuing the laconics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the naughty Green, who knew full well they had; for
      he had seen them run into their fox as he stood on Dinglebank Hill; and,
      moreover, had ridden part of the way home with Tommy Heslop, who had a
      pad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve been down!&rdquo; exclaimed the Commissioner, starting round at the
      unwonted announcement of Gameboy Green, the best man of their hunt, not
      knowing if they had killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down, aye,&rdquo; repeated Gameboy, looking at his soiled side, which looked as
      if he had been at a sculptor&rsquo;s, having a mud cast taken of himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      indebted to the nasty little jealous Damper for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Damper!&rdquo; exclaimed the Commissioner, knowing how the Earl hated him.
      &ldquo;The Damper! that little rascally draper&rsquo;s always doing something wrong.
      How did he manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just charged me as I was taking a fence,&rdquo; replied Green, &ldquo;and knocked me
      clean over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a shame!&rdquo; exclaimed the Commissioner, driving on. &ldquo;What a shame,&rdquo;
       repeated he, whipping his horse into a trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he proceeded, he presently fell in with Dr. Pillerton, to whom he
      related how infamously the Hit-im and Hold-im shire chaps had used poor
      Green, breaking three of his ribs, and nearly knocking his eye out. And
      Dr. Pillerton, ever anxious, &amp;c., told D&rsquo;Orsay Davis, the great we of
      the Featherbedfordshire Gazette, who forthwith penned such an article on
      fox-hunting Jealousy, generally, and Hit-im and Hold-im shire Jealousy in
      particular, as caused Sir Moses to declare he&rsquo;d horsewhip him the first
      time he caught him,&mdash;&ldquo;dom&rsquo;d if he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>OUR oss sall be
      seek&mdash;down in de mouth dis mornin&rsquo;, sare,&rdquo; observed
      Monsieur to Billy, as the latter lay tossing about in his uncomfortable
      bed, thinking how he could shirk that day&rsquo;s hunting penance; Sir
      Moses, with his usual dexterity, having evaded the offer of lending him a
      horse, by saying that Billy&rsquo;s having nothing to do the day before
      would be quite fresh for the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall be w-h-a-w-t?&rdquo; drawled our hero, dreading the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down in de mouth&mdash;seek&mdash;onvell,&rdquo; replied Jack, depositing the
      top-boots by the sofa, and placing the shaving-water on the toilette
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is he!&rdquo; said Billy, perking up, thinking he saw his way out of the
      dilemma. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He coughs, sare&mdash;he does not feed, sare&mdash;and altogether he is
      not right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-o-o,&rdquo; said Billy, conning the matter over&mdash;&ldquo;then, p&rsquo;raps I&rsquo;d
      better not ride him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vot you think right, sare,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;He is your quadruped, not
      mine; but I should not say he is vot dey call, op to snoff&mdash;fit to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied Billy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not ride &lsquo;im! hate a horse that&rsquo;s not up to the
      mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sare Moses Baronet vod perhaps lend you von, sare,&rdquo; suggested Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by no means!&rdquo; replied Billy in a fright. &ldquo;By no means! I&rsquo;d just as
      soon not hunt to-day, in fact, for I&rsquo;ve got a good many letters to write
      and things to do; so just take the water away for the present and bring it
      back when Sir Moses is gone.&rdquo; So saying, Billy turned over on his thin
      pillow, and again sought the solace of his couch. He presently fell into a
      delightful dreamy sort of sleep, in which he fancied that after dancing
      the Yammerton girls all round, he had at length settled into an
      interminable &ldquo;Ask Mamma Polka,&rdquo; with Clara, from which he was disagreeably
      aroused by Jack Rogers&rsquo; hirsute face again protruding between the
      partially-drawn curtains, announcing, &ldquo;Sare Moses Baronet, sare, has cot
      his stick&mdash;is off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Moses, <i>what!</i>&rdquo; started Billy, dreading to hear about the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sare Moses Baronet, sare, is gone, and I&rsquo;ve brought you your <i>l&rsquo;eau
      chaude</i>, as you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, rubbing his eyes and recollecting himself,
      &ldquo;all right;&rdquo; and, banishing the beauty, he jumped out of bed and resigned
      himself to Rogers, who forthwith commenced the elaborate duties of his
      office. As it progressed he informed Billy how the land lay. &ldquo;Sare Moses
      was gone, bot Coddy was left, and Mrs. Margerum said there should be no <i>déjeuner</i>
      for Cod&rdquo; (who was a bad tip), till Billy came down. And Jack didn&rsquo;t put
      himself at all out of his way to expedite matters to accommodate Cuddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Billy descended in a suit of those tigerish tweeds into which he
      had lapsed since he got away from Mamma, and was received with a round of
      tallihos and view-holloas by Cuddy, who had been studying <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>
      with exemplary patience in the little bookless library, reading through
      all the meets of the hounds as if he was going to send a horse to each of
      them. Then Cuddy took his revenge on the servants by ringing for
      everything he could think of, demanding them all in the name of Mr.
      Pringle; just as an old parish constable used to run frantically about a
      fair demanding assistance from everybody in the name of the Queen. Mr.
      Pringle wanted devilled turkey, Mr. Pringle wanted partridge pie, Mr.
      Pringle wanted sausages, Mr. Pringle wanted chocolate, Mr. Pringle wanted
      honey, jelly and preserve. Why the deuce, didn&rsquo;t they send Mr. Pringle his
      breakfast in properly? And if the servants didn&rsquo;t think Billy a very great
      man, it wasn&rsquo;t for want of Cuddy trying to make them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, what with Cuddy&rsquo;s exertions and the natural course of events,
      Billy obtained a very good breakfast. The last cup being at length
      drained, Cuddy clutched <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>, and wheeling his semicircular
      chair round to the fire, dived into his side pocket, and, producing a
      cigar-case, tendered Billy a weed. And Cuddy did it in such a
      matter-of-course way, that much as Billy disliked smoking, he felt
      constrained to accept one, thinking to get rid of it by a sidewind, just
      as he had got rid of old Wotherspoon&rsquo;s snuff, by throwing it away. So,
      taking his choice, he lit it, and prepared to beat a retreat, but was
      interrupted by Cuddy asking where &ldquo;he was going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only into the open air,&rdquo; replied Billy, with the manner of a professed
      smoker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open air, be hanged!&rdquo; retorted Cuddy. &ldquo;Open airs well enough in
      summer-time when the roses are out, and the strawberries ripe, but this is
      not the season for that kind of sport. No, no, come and sit here, man,&rdquo;
       continued he, drawing a chair alongside of him for Billy, &ldquo;and let&rsquo;s have
      a chat about hunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Sir Moses won&rsquo;t like his room smoked in,&rdquo; observed Billy, making a
      last effort to be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sir Moses don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; rejoined Cuddy, with a jerk of his head; &ldquo;Sir
      Moses don&rsquo;t care! can&rsquo;t hurt such rubbish as this,&rdquo; added he, tapping the
      arm of an old imitation rose-wood painted chair that stood on his left.
      &ldquo;No old furniture broker in the Cut, would give ten puns for the whole
      lot, curtains, cushions, and all,&rdquo; looking at the faded red hangings
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Billy was obliged to sit down and proceed with his cigar. Meanwhile
      Cuddy having established a good light to his own, took up his left leg to
      nurse, and proceeded with his sporting speculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, hunting wasn&rsquo;t what it used to be (whiff), nor racing either (puff).
      Never was a truer letter (puff), than that of Lord Derby&rsquo;s (whiff), in
      which he said racing had got into the (puff) hands of (whiff) persons of
      an inferior (puff) position, who keep (puff) horses as mere instruments of
      (puff) gambling, instead of for (whiff) sport.&rdquo; Then, having pruned the
      end of his cigar, he lowered his left leg and gave his right one a turn,
      while he indulged in some hunting recollections. &ldquo;Hunting wasn&rsquo;t what it
      used to be (puff) in the days of old (whiff) Warde and (puff) Villebois
      and (whiff) Masters. Ah no!&rdquo; continued he, taking his cigar out of his
      month, and casting his eye up at the dirty fly-dotted ceiling. &ldquo;Few such
      sportsmen as poor Sutton or Ralph Lambton, or that fine old fire-brick,
      Assheton Smith. People want to be all in the ring now, instead of sticking
      to one sport, and enjoying it thoroughly&mdash;yachts, manors, moors,
      race-horses, cricket, coaches, coursing, cooks&mdash;and the consequence
      is, they get blown before they are thirty, and have to live upon air the
      rest of their lives. Wasn&rsquo;t one man in fifty that hunted who really
      enjoyed it. See how glad they were to tail off as soon as they could. A
      good knock on the nose, or a crack on the crown settled half of them.
      Another thing was, there was no money to be made by it. Nothing an
      Englishman liked so much as making money, or trying to make it.&rdquo; So
      saying, Cuddy gave his cigar another fillip, and replacing it in his
      mouth, proceeded to blow a series of long revolving clouds, as he lapsed
      into a heaven of hunting contemplations.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these he was suddenly aroused by the violent retching of Billy. Our
      friend, after experiencing the gradual growth of seasickness mingled with
      a stupifying headache, was at length fairly overcome, and Cuddy had just
      time to bring the slop-basin to the rescue. Oh, how green Billy looked!
    </p>
    <h3>
      ****
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too soon after breakfast&mdash;too soon after breakfast,&rdquo; muttered Cuddy,
      disgusted at the interruption. &ldquo;Lie down for half an hour, lie down for
      half an hour,&rdquo; continued he ringing the bell violently for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s valet here! send Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s valet here!&rdquo; exclaimed
      he, as the half-davered footman came staring in, followed by the
      ticket-of-leave butler, &ldquo;Here, Monsieur!&rdquo; continued he, as Rougier&rsquo;s hairy
      face now peeped past the door, &ldquo;your master wants you&mdash;eat something
      that&rsquo;s disagreed with him&mdash;that partridge-pie, I think, for I feel
      rather squeamish myself; and you, Bankhead,&rdquo; added he, addressing the
      butler, &ldquo;just bring us each a drop of brandy, not that nasty brown stuff
      Mother Margermn puts into the puddings, but some of the white, you know&mdash;the
      best, you know,&rdquo; saying which, with a &ldquo;now old boy!&rdquo; he gave Billy a hoist
      from his seat by the arm, and sent him away with his servant. The brandy,
      however, never came, Bankhead declaring they had drunk all he had out, the
      other night. So Cuddy was obliged to console himself with his cigars and
      <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i>, which latter he read, marked, learned, and inwardly
      digested, pausing every now and then at the speculative passages,
      wondering whether Wilkinson and Kidd, or Messrs. Wilkinson and Co. were
      the parties who had the honour of having his name on their books, where
      Henry Just, the backer of horses, got the Latin for his advertisement
      from, and considering whether Nairn Sahib, the Indian fiend, should be
      roasted alive or carried round the world in a cage. He also went through
      the column and a quarter of the meets of hounds again, studied the doings
      at Copenhagen Grounds, Salford Borough Gardens, and Hornsea Wood, and
      finally finished off with the time of high-water at London Bridge, and the
      list of pedestrian matches to come. He then folded the paper carefully up
      and replaced it in his pocket, feeling equal to a dialogue with anybody.
      Having examined the day through the window, he next strolled to his old
      friend the weather-glass at the bottom of the stairs, and then
      constituting himself huntsman to a pack of hounds, proceeded to draw the
      house for our Billy; &ldquo;<i>Y-o-o-icks</i>, wind him! <i>y-o-o-icks</i>, push
      him up!&rdquo; holloaed he, going leisurely up-stairs, &ldquo;<i>E&rsquo;leu in there! E&rsquo;leu
      in!</i>&rdquo; continued he, on arriving at a partially closed door on the first
      landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>There&rsquo;s nobody here! There&rsquo;s nobody here!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
      Margerum, hurrying out. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody here, sir!&rdquo; repeated she, holding
      steadily on by the door, to prevent any one entering where she was busy
      packing her weekly basket of perquisites, or what the Americans more
      properly call &ldquo;stealings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody here! bitch-fox, at all events!&rdquo; retorted Cuddy, eyeing her
      confusion&mdash;&ldquo;where&rsquo;s Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s room?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you, sir; I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; replied she, closing the room-door,
      and hurrying on to another one further along. &ldquo;This is Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s room,
      sir,&rdquo; said she, stopping before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; exclaimed Cuddy, knocking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; replied a feeble voice from within; and in Cuddy went.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    </p>

    <p>
      There was Billy in bed, with much such a disconsolate face as he had when
      Jack Rogers appeared with his hunting things. As, however, nobody ever
      admits being sick with smoking, Billy readily adopted Cuddy&rsquo;s suggestion,
      and laid the blame on the pie. Cuddy, indeed, was good enough to say he
      had been sick himself, and of course Billy had a right to be so, too.
      &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t have been so,&rdquo; said Cuddy, &ldquo;if that beggar Bankhead had brought
      the brandy; but there&rsquo;s no getting anything out of that fellow.&rdquo; And Caddy
      and Billy being then placed upon terms of equality, the interesting
      invalids agreed to have a walk together. To this end Billy turned out of
      bed and re-established himself in his recently-discarded coat and vest;
      feeling much like a man after a bad passage from Dover to Calais. The two
      then toddled down-stairs together, Cuddy stopping at the bottom of the
      flight to consult his old friend the glass, and speculate upon the
      Weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash it! but it&rsquo;s falling,&rdquo; said he, with a shake of
      the head after tapping it. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t like the looks of the sky
      this morning&mdash;wish there mayn&rsquo;t be a storm brewing. Had one
      just about this time last year. Would be a horrid bore if hunting was
      stopped just in its prime,&rdquo; and talked like a man with half-a-dozen
      horses fit to jump out of their skins, instead of not owning one. And
      Billy thought it would be the very thing for him if hunting was stopped.
      With a somewhat light heart, he followed Cuddy through the back slums to
      the stables.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Moses doesn&rsquo;t sacrifice much to appearances, does he?&rdquo; asked Cuddy,
      pointing to the wretched rough-cast peeling off the back walls of the
      house, which were greened with the drippings of the broken spouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Billy, staring about, thinking how different things looked
      there to what they did at the Carstle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Desperately afraid of paint,&rdquo; continued Cuddy, looking about. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      think there has been a lick of paint laid upon any place since he got it.
      Always tell him he&rsquo;s like a bad tenant at the end of a long lease,&rdquo; which
      observation brought them to the first stable-door. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; cried
      Cuddy, kicking at the locked entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; demanded a voice from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! <i>Mr. Flintoff</i>&rsquo;!&rdquo; replied Cuddy, in a tone of authority; &ldquo;<i>open
      the door</i>&rdquo; added he, imperiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dirty-shirted helper had seen them coming; but the servants generally
      looking upon Cuddy as a spy, the man had locked the door upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, sir,&rdquo; now said the Catiff, pulling at his cowlick as he
      opened it; &ldquo;beg pardon, sir, didn&rsquo;t know it was you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; replied Cuddy, adding, &ldquo;you might have known by my knock,&rdquo;
       saying which Cuddy stuck his cheesey hat down on his nose, and pocketing
      his hands, proceeded to scrutinise the stud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this &lsquo;orse got a bandage on for?&rdquo; asked he about one. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
      ye let that &lsquo;orse&rsquo;s &lsquo;ead down?&rdquo; demanded he of another. &ldquo;Strip
      this &rsquo;orse,&rdquo; ordered he of a third. Then Cuddy stood criticising his
      points, his legs, his loins, his hocks, his head, his steep shoulder, as
      he called it, and then ordered the clothes to be put on again. So he went
      from stable to stable, just as he does at Tattersall&rsquo;s on a Sunday, Cuddy
      being as true to the &ldquo;corner&rdquo; as the needle to the pole, though, like the
      children, he looks, but <i>never</i> touches, that is to say, &ldquo;bids,&rdquo; at
      least not for himself. Our Billy, soon tiring of this amusement&mdash;if,
      indeed, amusement it can be called&mdash;availed himself of the
      interregnum caused by the outside passage from one set of stables to
      another, to slip away to look after his own horse, of whose health he
      suddenly remembered Rougier had spoken disparagingly in the morning. After
      some little trouble he found the Juniper-smelling head groom, snoring
      asleep among a heap of horse-cloths before the fire in the saddle-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that a man who is never exactly sober is never quite drunk, and
      Jack Wetun was one of this order, he was always running to the
      &ldquo;unsophisticated gin-bottle,&rdquo; keeping up the steam of excitement, but
      seldom overtopping it, and could shake himself into apparent sobriety in
      an instant. Like most of Sir Moses&rsquo;s people, he was one of the fallen
      angels of servitude, having lived in high places, from which his
      intemperate habits had ejected him; and he was now gradually descending to
      that last refuge of the destitute, the Ostlership of a farmer&rsquo;s inn.
      Starting out of his nest at the rousing shake of the helper, who holloaed
      in his ear that &ldquo;Mr. Pringle wanted to see his &lsquo;orse,&rdquo; Wetun stretched his
      brawny arms, and, rubbing his eyes, at length comprehended Billy, when he
      exclaimed with a start, &ldquo;Oss, sir? Oh, by all means, sir;&rdquo; and, bundling
      on his greasy-collared, iron-grey coat, he reeled and rolled out of the
      room, followed by our friend. &ldquo;That (hiccup) oss of (hiccup) yours is
      (hiccup) amiss, I think (hiccup), sir,&rdquo; said he, leading, or rather
      lurching the way. &ldquo;A w-h-a-w-t?&rdquo; drawled Billy, watching Weton&rsquo;s tack and
      half-tack gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amiss (hiccup)&mdash;unwell&mdash;don&rsquo;t like his (hiccup) looks,&rdquo; replied
      the groom, rolling past the stable-door where he was. &ldquo;Oh, beg pardon,&rdquo;
       exclaimed he, bumping against Billy on turning short back, as he suddenly
      recollected himself; &ldquo;Beg pardon, he&rsquo;s in here,&rdquo; added he, fumbling at the
      door. It was locked. Then, oh dear, he hadn&rsquo;t got the (hiccup) key, then
      (hiccup); yes, he had got the (hiccup) key, as he recollected he had his
      coat on, and dived into the pocket for it. Then he produced it; and, after
      making several unsuccessful pokes at the key-hole, at length accomplished
      an entry, and Billy again saw Napoleon the Great, now standing in the
      promised two-stalled stable along with Sir Moses&rsquo;s gig mare.
    </p>
    <p>
      To a man with any knowledge of horses, Napoleon certainly did look very
      much amiss&mdash;more like a wooden horse at a harness-maker&rsquo;s, than an
      animal meant to go,&mdash;stiff, with his fore-logs abroad, and an anxious
      care-worn countenance continually cast back at its bearing flanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Billy, looking him over, as he thought, very knowingly. &ldquo;Not
      so much amiss, either, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, what you think,&rdquo; replied Wetun, glad to find that Billy didn&rsquo;t
      blame him for his bad night&rsquo;s lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I dare say he&rsquo;ll be all right in a day or two,&rdquo; observed
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, half inclined to recommend his having his feet put into warm water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ope so,&rdquo; replied Wetun, looking up the horse&rsquo;s red nostrils, adding, &ldquo;but
      he&rsquo;s not (hiccup) now, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a long reverberating crack sounded through the courtyard,
      followed by the clattering of horses&rsquo; hoofs, and Wetun exclaiming, &ldquo;<i>Here
      be Sir Moses!</i>&rdquo; dropped the poor horse&rsquo;s head, and hurried ont to meet his
      master, accompanied by Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Pringle!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, gaily throwing his leg over his
      horse&rsquo;s head as he alighted. &ldquo;Ah, Pringle, my dear fellow, what, got you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what sport?&rdquo; demanded Cuddy Flintoff, rushing up with eager anxiety
      depicted on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, stamping the mud off his boots, and then
      giving himself a general shake; &ldquo;very good,&rdquo; repeated he; &ldquo;found at
      Lobjolt Corse&mdash;-ran up the banks and down the banks, and across to
      Beatie&rsquo;s Bog, then over to Deep-well Rocks, and back again to the banks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Did you kill?</i>&rdquo; demanded Cuddy, not wanting to hear any more about
      the banks&mdash;up the banks or down the banks either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, moodily; &ldquo;if that dom&rsquo;d old Daddy Nevins
      hadn&rsquo;t stuck his ugly old mug right in the way, we should have forced him
      over Willowsike Pastures, and doubled him up in no time, for we were close
      upon him; whereas the old infidel brought us to a check, aud we never
      could get upon terms with him again; but, come,&rdquo; continued Sir Moses,
      wishing to cut short this part of the narrative, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go into the house
      and get ourselves warmed, for the air&rsquo;s cold, and I haven&rsquo;t had a bite
      since breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, come in!&rdquo; cried Cuddy, leading the way; &ldquo;come in, and get Mr. Pringle
      a drop of brandy, for he&rsquo;s eat something that&rsquo;s disagreed with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat something that&rsquo;s disagreed with him. Sorry to hear that; what could
      it be?&mdash;what could it be?&rdquo; asked Sir Moses, as the party now groped
      their way along the back passages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I blame the partridge-pie,&rdquo; replied Cuddy, demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; rejoined Sir Moses&mdash;&ldquo;not a bit of it! eat some
      myself&mdash;eat some myself&mdash;will finish it now&mdash;will finish it
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve saved you that trouble,&rdquo; replied Cuddy, &ldquo;for we finished it
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce you did!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, adding, &ldquo;and were <i>you</i>
      sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squeamish,&rdquo; replied Cuddy&mdash;&ldquo;Squeamish; not so bad as Mr. Pringle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But bad enough to want some brandy, I suppose,&rdquo; observed the Baronet, now
      entering the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Cuddy&mdash;&ldquo;quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you get some?&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t you get some?&rdquo; asked the
      Baronet, moving towards the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because Bankhead has none out,&rdquo; replied Mr. Cuddy, before Sir Moses rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None out!&rdquo; retorted Sir Moses&mdash;&ldquo;none out!&mdash;what! have you
      finished that too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody has, it seems,&rdquo; replied Cuddy, quite innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll tell you what you must do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you
      must do,&rdquo; continued the Baronet, lighting a little red taper, and feeling
      in his pocket for the keys&mdash;&ldquo;you must go into the cellar yourself and
      get some&mdash;go into the cellar yourself and get some;&rdquo; so saying, Sir
      Moses handed Cuddy the candle and keys, saying, &ldquo;shelf above the left hand
      bin behind the door,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;you know it&mdash;you know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better bring two when I&rsquo;m there, hadn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; asked Cuddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, dryly, &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose there&rsquo;ll be no great harm if you
      do;&rdquo; and away Cuddy went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-e-e-a-vil of a fellow to drink&mdash;d-e-e-a-vil of a fellow to drink,&rdquo;
       drawled Sir Moses, listening to his receding footsteps along the passage.
      He then directed his blarney to Billy. &ldquo;Oh dear, he was sorry to hear he&rsquo;d
      been ill; what could it be? Lost a nice gallop, too&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if he
      hadn&rsquo;t. Couldn&rsquo;t be the pie! Wondered he wasn&rsquo;t down in the morning.&rdquo; Then
      Billy explained that his horse was ill, and that prevented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horse ill!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, throwing out his hands, and raising his
      brows with astonishment&mdash;&ldquo;horse ill! O dear, but that shouldn&rsquo;t have
      stopped you, if I&rsquo;d known&mdash;should have been most welcome to any of
      mine&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if you shouldn&rsquo;t! There&rsquo;s Pegasus, or Atalanta, or
      Will-o&rsquo;-the-Wisp, or any of them, fit to go. O dear, it was a sad mistake
      not sending word. Wonder what Wetun was about not to tell me&mdash;would
      row him for not doing so,&rdquo; and as Sir Moses went on protesting and
      professing and proposing, Cuddy Flintoff&rsquo;s footstep and &ldquo;<i>for-rard on!
      for-rard on!</i>&rdquo; were heard returning along the passage, and he presently
      entered with a bottle in each hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a brace of beauties!&rdquo; exclaimed he, placing them on the round
      table, with the dew of the cellar fresh on their sides&mdash;&ldquo;there are a
      brace of blood-like beauties!&rdquo; repeated he, eyeing their neat tapering
      necks, &ldquo;the very race-horse of bottles&mdash;perfect pictures, I declare;
      so different to those great lumbering roundshouldered English things, that
      look like black beer or porter, or something of that sort.&rdquo; Then Cuddy ran
      off for glasses and tumblers and water; and Sir Moses, having taken a
      thimble-full of brandy, retired to change his clothes, declaring he felt
      chilly; and Cuddy, reigning in his stead, made Billy two such uncommonly
      strong brews, that we are sorry to say he had to be put to bed shortly
      after.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Mr. Bankhead heard that Cuddy Flintoff had been sent to the
      cellar instead of him, he declared it was the greatest insult that had
      ever been offered to a gentleman of his &ldquo;order,&rdquo; and vowed that he would
      turn his master off the first thing in the morning.

      CHAPTER XXXIX.<br/>MR. PRINGLE SUDDENLY BECOMES A MEMBER OF THE H. H. H.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EXT day being a
      &ldquo;dies non&rdquo; in the hunting way, Sir Moses Mainchance lay at earth to
      receive his steward, Mr. Mordecai Nathan, and hear what sport he had had
      as well in hunting up arrears of rent as in the management of the Pangburn
      Park estate generally. Very sorry the accounts were, many of the apparent
      dullard farmers being far more than a match for the sharp London Jew. Mr.
      Mordecai Nathan indeed, declared that it would require a detective
      policeman to watch each farm, so tricky and subtile were the occupants.
      And as Sir Moses listened to the sad recitals, how Henery Brown &amp; Co.
      had been leading off their straw by night, and Mrs. Turnbull selling her
      hay by day, and Jacky Hindmarch sowing his fallows without ever taking out
      a single weed, he vowed that they were a set of the biggest rogues under
      the sun, and deserved to be hung all in a row,&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if they didn&rsquo;t!
      And he moved and seconded and carried a resolution in his own mind, that
      the man who meddled with land as a source of revenue was a very great
      goose. So, charging Mr. Mordecai Nathan to stick to them for the money,
      promising him one per cent. more (making him eleven) on what he recovered,
      he at length dissolved the meeting, most heartily wishing he had Pangburn
      Park in his pocket again. Meanwhile Messrs. Flintoff and Pringle had
      yawned away the morning in the usual dreamy loungy style of guests in
      country-houses, where the meals are the chief incidents of the day. Mr.
      Pringle not choosing to be tempted with any more &ldquo;pie,&rdquo; had slipped away
      to the stable as soon as Cuddy produced the dread cigar-case after
      breakfast, and there had a conference with Mr. Wetun, the stud-groom,
      about his horse Napoleon the Great. The drunkard half laughed when Billy
      asked &ldquo;if he thought the horse would be fit to come out in the morning,
      observing that he thought it would be a good many mornins fust, adding
      that Mr. Fleams the farrier had bled him, but he didn&rsquo;t seem any better,
      and that he was coming back at two o&rsquo;clock, when p&rsquo;raps Mr. Pringle had
      better see him himself.&rdquo; Whereupon our friend Billy, recollecting Sir
      Moses&rsquo;s earnest deprecation of his having stayed at home for want of a
      horse the day before, and the liberal way he had talked of Atalanta and
      Pegasus, and he didn&rsquo;t know what else, now charged Mr. Wetun not to
      mention his being without a horse, lest Sir Moses might think it necessary
      to mount him; which promise being duly accorded, Billy, still shirking
      Cuddy, sought the retirement of his chamber, where he indited an epistle
      to his anxious Mamma, telling her all, how he had left Major Yammerton&rsquo;s
      and the dangerous eyes, and had taken up his quarters with Sir Moses
      Mainchance, a great fox-hunting Hit-im and Hold-im shire Baronet at
      Pangburn Park, expecting she would be very much pleased and struck with
      the increased consequence. Instead of which, however, though Mrs. Pringle
      felt that he had perhaps hit upon the lesser evil, she wrote him a very
      loving letter by return of post, saying she was glad to hear he was
      enjoying himself, but cautioning him against &ldquo;Moses Mainchance&rdquo; (omitting
      the Sir), adding that every man&rsquo;s character was ticketed in London, and
      the letters &ldquo;D. D.&rdquo; for &ldquo;Dirty Dog&rdquo; were appended to his. She also told
      him that uncle Jerry had been inquiring about him, and begging she would
      call upon him at an early day on matters of business, all of which will
      hereafter &ldquo;more full and at large appear,&rdquo; as the lawyers say; meanwhile,
      we must back the train of ideas a little to our hero. Just as he was
      affixing the great seal of state to the letter, Cuddy Flintoff&rsquo;s &ldquo;for-rard
      on! for-rard on!&rdquo; was heard progressing along the passage, followed by a
      noisy knock, with an exclamation of &ldquo;Pringle&rdquo; at our friend&rsquo;s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; cried he; and in obedience to the invitation, Flintoff stood in
      the doorway. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that we dine at Hinton to-day, and
      the Baronet&rsquo;s ordered the trap at four,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to dress, and
      you&rsquo;d better do the same.&rdquo; So saying, Cuddy closed the door, and hunted
      himself along to his own room at the end of the passage&mdash;&ldquo;<i>E&rsquo;leu in
      there! E&rsquo;leu in!</i>&rdquo; oried he as he got to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hinton, once the second town in Hit-im and Hold-im shire, stands at the
      confluence of the Long Brawlinerford and Riplinton brooks, whose united
      efforts here succeed in making a pretty respectable stream. It is an
      old-fashioned country place, whose component parts may be described as
      consisting of an extensive market-place, with a massive church of the
      florid Gothic, or gingerbread order of architecture at one end, a quaint
      stone-roofed, stone-pillared market cross at the other, the Fox and Hounds
      hotel and posting-house on the north side, with alternating shops and
      public houses on the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its population, according to a certain &ldquo;sore subject&rdquo; topographical
      dictionary, was 23,500, whilst its principal trade might have been
      described as &ldquo;fleecing the foxhunters.&rdquo; That was in its golden days, when
      Lord Martingal hunted the country, holding his court at the Fox and Hounds
      hotel, where gentlemen stayed with their studs for months and months
      together, instead of whisking about with their horses by steam. Then every
      stable in the town was occupied at very remunerative rents, and the
      inhabitants seemed to think they could never build enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the natives of most isolated places, the Hintonites were very
      self-sufficient, firmly believing that there were no such conjurors as
      themselves; and, when the Grumpletin railway was projected, they resolved
      that it would ruin their town, and so they opposed it to a man, and
      succeeded in driving it several miles off, thus scattering their trade
      among other places along the line. Year by year the bonnet and mantle
      shops grew less gay, the ribbons less attractive, until shop after shop
      lapsed into a sort of store, hardware on one side, and millinery, perhaps,
      on the other. But the greatest fall of all was that of the Fox and Hounds
      hotel and posting-house. This spacious hostelry had apparently been built
      with a view of accommodating everybody; and, at the time of our story, it
      loomed in deserted grandeur in the great grass-grown market-place. In
      structure it was more like a continental inn than an English one;
      quadrangular, entered by a spacious archway, from whose lofty ceiling hung
      the crooks, from whence used to dangle the glorious legs and loins of
      four-year-old mutton, the home-fed hams, the geese, the ducks, the game,
      with not unfrequently a haunch or two of presentation venison. With the
      building, however, the similarity ended, the cobble-stoned courtyard
      displaying only a few water-casks and a basket-caged jay, in lieu of the
      statues, and vases, and fountains, and flower-stands that grace the
      flagged courts of the continent. But in former days it boasted that which
      in the eye of our innkeeper passes show, namely, a goodly line of
      two-horse carriages drawn across its ample width. In those days county
      families moved like county families, in great, caravan-like carriages,
      with plenty of servants, who, having drunk the &ldquo;Park or Hall&rdquo; allowance,
      uphold their characters and the honour of their houses, by topping up the
      measure of intemperance with their own money. Their masters and
      mistresses, too, considered the claims of the innkeepers, and ate and
      drank for the good of the house, instead of sneaking away to pastry-cooks
      for their lunches at a third of the price of the inn ones. Not that any
      landlord had ever made money at the Fox and Hounds hotel. Oh, no! it would
      never do to admit that. Indeed, Mr. Binny used to declare, if it wasn&rsquo;t
      &ldquo;the great regard he had for Lord Martingal and the gents of his hunt,
      he&rsquo;d just as soon be without their custom;&rdquo; just as all Binnys decry,
      whatever they have&mdash;military messes, hunt messes, bar messes, any
      sort of messes. They never make anything by them&mdash;not they.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, that the hunt was irrevocably gone, words were inadequate to
      convey old Peter the waiter&rsquo;s lamentations at its loss. &ldquo;Oh dear, sir!&rdquo; he
      would say, as he showed a stranger the club-room, once the eighth wonder
      of the world, &ldquo;Oh dear, sir! I never thought to see things come to this
      pass. This room, sir, used to be occupied night after night, and every
      Wednesday we had more company than it could possibly hold. Now we have
      nothing but a miserable three-and-sixpence a head once a month, with Sir
      Moses in the chair, and a shilling a bottle for corkage. Formerly we had
      six shillings a bottle for port and five for sherry, which, as our
      decanters didn&rsquo;t hold three parts, was pretty good pay.&rdquo; Then Peter would
      open the shutters and show the proportions of the room, with the
      unrivalled pictures on the walls: Lord Martingal on his horse, Lord
      Martingal off his horse; Mr. Customer on his horse, Mr. Customer off his
      horse, Mr. Customer getting drunk; Mr. Crasher on his horse, Mr. Crasher
      with a hound, &amp;c., all in the old woodeny style that prevailed before
      the gallant Grant struck out a fresh light in his inimitable &ldquo;Breakfast,&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;Meet of the Stag-hounds.&rdquo; But the reader will perhaps accompany us to
      one of Sir Moses&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wednesday evenings;&rdquo; for which purpose they will have
      the goodness to suppose the Baronet and Mr. Flintoff arrayed in the dress
      uniform of the hunt&mdash;viz., scarlet coats with yellow collars and
      facings, and Mr. Pringle attired in the height of the fashion, bundling
      into one of those extraordinary-shaped vehicles that modern times have
      introduced. &ldquo;<i>Right!</i>&rdquo; cries the footman from the steps of the door,
      as Bankhead and Monsieur mount the box of the carriage, and away the
      well-muffled party drive to the scene of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great drawback to the Hit-im and Hold-im shire hunt club-room at the
      Fox and Hounds hotel and posting-house at Hinton, undoubtedly was, that
      there was no ante or reception room. The guests on alighting from their
      vehicles, after ascending the broad straight flight of stairs, found
      themselves suddenly precipitated into the dazzling dining-room, with such
      dismantling accommodation only as a low screen before the door at the
      low-end of the room afforded. The effect therefore was much the or same as
      if an actor dressed for his part on the stage before the audience; a
      fox-hunter in his wraps, and a fox-hunter in his red, being very distinct
      and different beings. It was quite destructive of anything like imposing
      flourish or effect. Moreover the accumulation of steaming things on a wet
      night, which it generally was on a club dinner, added but little to the
      fragrance of the room. So much for generalities; we will now proceed to
      our particular dinner.

      Sir Moses being the great gun of the evening, of course timed himself to
      arrive becomingly late&mdash;indeed the venerable post-boy who drove him,
      knew to a moment when to arrive; and as the party ascended the straight
      flight of stairs they met a general buzz of conversation coming down, high
      above which rose the discordant notes of the Laughing Hyæna. It was the
      first hunt-dinner of the season, and being the one at which Sir Moses
      generally broached his sporting requirements, parties thought it prudent
      to be present, as well as to hear the prospects of the season as to
      protect their own pockets. To this end some twenty or five-and-twenty
      variegated guests were assembled, the majority dressed in the red coat and
      yellow facings of the hunt, exhibiting every variety of cut, from the
      tight short-waisted swallow-tails of Mr. Crasher&rsquo;s (the contemporary of
      George the Fourth) reign, down to the sack-like garment of the present
      day. Many of them looked as if, having got into their coats, they were
      never to get out of them again, but as pride feels no pain, if asked about
      them, they would have declared they were quite comfortable. The
      dark-coated gentry were principally farmers, and tradespeople, or the
      representatives of great men in the neighbourhood. Mr. Buckwheat, Mr.
      Doubledrill, Mr. James Corduroys, Mr. Stephen Broadfurrow; Mr. Pica, of
      the &ldquo;Hit-im and Hold-im shire Herald;&rdquo; Hicks, the Flying Hatter, and his
      shadow Tom Snowdon the draper or Damper, Manford the corn-merchant, Smith
      the saddler. Then there was Mr. Mossman, Lord Polkaton&rsquo;s Scotch factor,
      Mr. Squeezeley, Sir Morgan Wildair&rsquo;s agent, Mr. Lute, on behalf of Lord
      Harpsichord, Mr. Stiff representing Sir George Persiflage, &amp;c., &amp;c.
      These latter were watching the proceedings for their employers, Sir Moses
      having declared that Mr. Mossman, on a former occasion (see page 188,
      ante), had volunteered to subscribe fifty pounds to the hounds, on behalf
      of Lord Polkaton, and Sir Moses had made his lordship pay it too&mdash;&ldquo;dom&rsquo;d
      if he hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; With this sketch of the company, let us now proceed to the
      entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the current of conversation had been anything but flattering to our
      master before his arrival, yet the reception they now gave him, as he
      emerged from behind the screen, might have made a less self-sufficient man
      than Sir Moses think he was extremely popular. Indeed, they rushed at him
      in a way that none but Briareus himself could have satisfied. They all
      wanted to hug him at once. Sir Moses having at length appeased their
      enthusiasm, and given his beak a good blow, proceeded to turn part of
      their politeness upon Billy, by introducing him to those around. Mr.
      Pringle, Mr. Jarperson&mdash;Mr. Pringle, Mr. Paul Straddler&mdash;Mr.
      Pringle, Mr. John Bullrush, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Cuddy Flintoff kept up a series of view halloas and hunting
      noises, as guest after guest claimed the loan of his hand for a shake. So
      they were all very hearty and joyful as members of a fox-hunting club
      ought to be.

      The rules of the Hit-im and Hold-im-shire hunt, like those of many other
      hunts and institutions, were sometimes very stringent, and sometimes very
      lax&mdash;very stringent when an objectionable candidate presented himself&mdash;very
      lax when a good one was to be obtained. On the present occasion Sir Moses
      Mainchance had little difficulty in persuading the meeting to suspend the
      salutary rule (No. 5) requiring each new candidate to be proposed and
      seconded at one meeting, and his name placed above the mantelpiece in the
      club-room, until he was ballotted for at another meeting, in favour of the
      nephew of his old friend and brother Baronet, Sir Jonathan Pringle; whom
      he described as a most promising young sportsman, and likely to make a
      most valuable addition to their hunt. And the members all seeing matters
      in that light, Cuddy Flintoff was despatched for the ballot-box, so that
      there might be no interruption to the advancement of dinner by summoning
      Peter. Meanwhile Sir Moses resumed the introductory process, Mr. Heslop
      Mr. Pringle, Mr. Pringle Mr. Smoothley, Mr. Drew Mr. Pringle, helping
      Billy to the names of such faces as he could not identity for want of
      their hunting caps. Cleverer fellows than Billy are puzzled to do that
      sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Mr. Flintoff returned with the rat-trap-like ballot-box under
      his arm, and a willow-pattern soup-plate with some beans in the bottom of
      it, in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make way!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;make way!&rdquo; advancing up the room with all the
      dignity of a mace-bearer. &ldquo;Where will you have it, Sir Moses?&rdquo; asked he,
      &ldquo;where will you have it, Sir Moses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; replied the Baronet, seizing a card-table from below the portrait
      of Mr. Customer getting drunk, and setting it out a little on the left of
      the fire. The ballot-box was then duly deposited on the centre of the
      green baize with a composite candle on each side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses, then thinking to make up in dignity what he had sacrificed to
      expediency, now called upon the meeting to appoint a Scrutineer on behalf
      of the club, and parties caring little who they named so long as they were
      not kept waiting for dinner, holloaed out &ldquo;Mr. Flintoff!&rdquo; whereupon Sir
      Moses put it to them if they were all content to have Mr. Flintoff
      appointed to the important and responsible office of Scrutineer, and
      receiving a shower of &ldquo;yes-es!&rdquo; in reply, he declared Mr. Flintoff was
      duly elected, and requested him to enter upon the duties of his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuddy, then turning up his red coat wrists, so that there might be no
      suspicion of concealed beans, proceeded to open and turn the drawers of
      the ballot-box upside down, in order to show that they were equally clear,
      and then restoring them below their &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; holes, he took his
      station behind the table with the soup-plate in his hand ready to drop a
      bean into each member&rsquo;s hand, as he advanced to receive it. Mr. Heslop
      presently led the way at a dead-march-in-Saul sort of pace, and other
      members falling in behind like railway passengers at a pay place, there
      was a continuous dropping of beans for some minutes, a solemn silence
      being preserved as if the parties expected to hear on which side they
      fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the constituency was exhausted, and Mr. Flintoff having assumed
      the sand-glass, and duly proclaimed that he should close the ballot, if no
      member appeared before the first glass was out, speedily declared it was
      run, when, laying it aside, he emptied the soup-plate of the remaining
      beans, and after turning it upside down to show the perfect fairness of
      the transaction, handed it to Sir Moses to hold for the result. Drawing
      out the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; drawer first, he proceeded with great gravity to count the
      beans out into the soup-plate&mdash;one, two, three, four, five, six,
      seven, and so on, up to eighteen, when the inverted drawer proclaimed they
      were done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen Ayes,&rdquo; announced Sir Moses to the meeting, amid a murmur of
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flintoff then produced the dread &ldquo;No,&rdquo; or black-ball drawer, whereof
      one to ten white excluded, and turning it upside down, announced, in a
      tone of triumph, &ldquo;<i>none!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, seizing our hero by both hands, and hugging him
      heartily&mdash;&ldquo;Hooray! give you joy, my boy! you&rsquo;re a member of the first
      club in the world! The Caledonian&rsquo;s nothing to it;&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if it is.&rdquo;
       So saying, he again swung him severely by the arms, and then handed him
      over to the meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus Mr. Pringle was elected a member of the Hit-im and Hold-im shire
      hunt, without an opportunity of asking his Mamma, for the best of all
      reasons, that Sir Moses had not even asked him himself.

    <p>
      CARCELY were the congratulations of the company to our hero, on his
      becoming a member of the renowned Hit-im and Hold-im shire hunt, over, ere
      a great rush of dinner poured into the room, borne by Peter and the usual
      miscellaneous attendants at an inn banquet; servants in livery, servants
      out of livery, servants in a sort of half-livery, servants in place,
      servants out of place, post-boys converted into footmen, &ldquo;boots&rdquo; put into
      shoes. Then the carrot and turnip garnished roasts and boils, and stews
      were crowded down the table, in a profusion that would astonish any one
      who thinks it impossible to dine under a guinea a head. Rounds, sirloins
      middles, sucking-pigs, poultry, &amp;c. (for they dispensed with the
      formalities of soup and fish ), being duly distributed. Peter announced
      the fact deferentially to Sir Moses, as he stood monopolizing the best
      place before the fire, whereupon the Baronet, drawing his hands out of his
      trowser&rsquo;s pockets, let fall his yellow lined gloves and clapping his
      hands, exclaimed. &ldquo;DINNER GENTLEMAN!&rdquo; in a stentorian voice, adding,
      &ldquo;PRINGLE you sit on my right! and CUDDY!&rdquo; appealing to our friend
      Flintoff&rsquo;. &ldquo;will you take the vice-chair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart!&rdquo; replied Cuddy, whereupon making an imaginary
      hunting-horn of his hand, he put it to his mouth, and went blowing and
      hooping down the room, to entice a certain portion of the guests after
      him. All parties being at length suited with seats, grace was said, and
      the assault commenced with the vigorous determination of over-due
      appetites.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a hand-in-the-pocket-hunt-dinner possesses few attractions in the way
      of fare, it is nevertheless free from the restraints and anxieties that
      pervade private entertainments, where the host cranes at the facetious as
      he scowls at his butler, or madame mingles her pleasantries with prayers
      for the safe arrival of the creams, and those extremely capricious
      sensitive jellies. People eat as if they had come to dine and not to talk,
      some, on this occasion, eating with their knives, some with their forks,
      some with both occasionally. And so, what with one aid and another, they
      made a very great clatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first qualms of hunger being at length appeased, Sir Moses proceeded
      to select subjects for politeness in the wine-taking way&mdash;men whom he
      could not exactly have at his own house, but who might be prevented from
      asking for cover-rent, or damages, by a little judicious flattery, or
      again, men who were only supposed to be lukewarmly disposed towards the
      great Hit-im and Hold-im shire hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses would rather put his hand into a chimney-sweep&rsquo;s pocket than
      into his own, but so long as anything could be got by the tongue he never
      begrudged it. So he &ldquo;sherried&rdquo; with Mossman and the army of observation
      generally, also with Pica, who always puffed his hunt, cutting at D&rsquo;Orsay
      Davis&rsquo;s efforts on behalf of the Earl, and with Buckwheat (whose son he
      had recently dom&rsquo;d à la Rowley Abingdon), and with Corduroys, and
      Straddler, and Hicks, and Doubledrill&mdash;with nearly all the dark
      coats, in short&mdash;Cuddy Flintoff, too, kept the game a-going at his
      end of the table, as well to promote conviviality as to get as much wine
      as he could; so altogether there was a pretty brisk consumption, and some
      of the tight-clad gentlemen began to look rather apoplectic.
      Cannon-ball-like plum-puddings, hip-bath-like apple-pies, and foaming
      creams, completed the measure of their uneasiness, and left little room
      for any cheese. Nature being at length most abundantly satisfied
      throughout the assembly, grace was again said, and the cloth cleared for
      action. The regulation port and sherry, with light&mdash;very light&mdash;Bordeaux,
      being duly placed upon the table, with piles of biscuits at intervals,
      down the centre, Sir Moses tapped the well-indented mahogany with his
      presidential hammer, and proceeded to prepare the guests for the great
      toast of the evening, by calling upon them to fill bumpers to the usual
      loyal and patriotic ones. These being duly disposed of, he at length rose
      for the all-important let off, amid the nudges and &ldquo;now then&rsquo;s,&rdquo; of such
      of the party as feared a fresh attempt on their pockets&mdash;Mossman and
      Co., in particular, were all eyes, ears, and fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; cries Sir Moses, rising and diving his hands into his
      trouser&rsquo;s pockets&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; repeated he, with an ominous cough,
      that sounded very like cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hark to the Bar owl!&mdash;hark</i>&rdquo; cheered Cuddy Flintoff from the
      other end of the room, thus cutting short a discussion about wool, a
      bargain for beans, and an inquiry for snuff in his own immediate
      neighbourhood, and causing a tapping of the table further up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; repeated Sir Moses, for the third time, amid cries of &ldquo;hear,
      hear,&rdquo; and &ldquo;order, order,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I now have the pleasure of introducing
      to your notice the toast of the evening&mdash;a toast endeared by a
      thousand associations, and rendered classical by the recollection of the
      great and good men who have given it in times gone by from this very chair&mdash;(applause).
      I need hardly say, gentlemen, that that toast is the renowned Hit-im and
      Hold-im shire hunt&mdash;(renewed applause)&mdash;a hunt second to none in
      the kingdom; a hunt whose name is famous throughout the land, and whose
      members are the very flower and élite of society&mdash;(renewed applause).
      Never, he was happy to say, since it was established, were its prospects
      so bright and cheering as they were at the present time&mdash;(great
      applause, the announcement being considered indicative of a healthy
      exchequer)&mdash;its country was great, its covers perfect, and thanks to
      their truly invaluable allies&mdash;the farmers&mdash;their foxes most
      abundant&mdash;(renewed applause). Of those excellent men it was
      impossible to speak in terms of too great admiration and respect&mdash;(applause)&mdash;whether
      he looked at those he was blessed with upon his own estate&mdash;(laughter)&mdash;or
      at the great body generally, he was lost for words to express his opinion
      of their patriotism, and the obligations he felt under to them. So far
      from ever hinting at such a thing as damage, he really believed a farmer
      would be hooted from the market-table who broached such a subject&mdash;(applause,
      with murmurs of dissent)&mdash;or who even admitted it was possible that
      any could be done&mdash;(laughter and applause). As for a few cocks and
      hens, he was sure they felt a pleasure in presenting them to the foxes. At
      all events, he could safely say he had never paid for any&mdash;(renewed
      laughter). Looking, therefore, at the hunt in all its aspects&mdash;its
      sport past, present, and to come&mdash;he felt that he never addressed
      them under circumstances of greater promise, or with feelings of livelier
      satisfaction. It only remained for them to keep matters up to the present
      mark, to insure great and permanent prosperity. He begged, therefore, to
      propose, with all the honours, Success to the Hit-im and Hold-im shire
      hunt!&rdquo;&mdash;(drunk with three times three and one cheer more). Sir Moses
      and Cuddy Flintoff mounting their chairs to mark time. Flintoff finishing
      off with a round of view halloas and other hunting noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the applause and Sir Moses had both subsided, parties who had felt
      uneasy about their pockets, began to breathe more freely, and as the
      bottles again circulated, Mr. Mossman and others, for whom wine was too
      cold, slipped out to get their pipes, and something warm in the bar;
      Mossman calling for whiskey, Buckwheat for brandy, Broadfurrow for gin,
      and so on. Then as they sugared and flavoured their tumblers, they chewed
      the cud of Sir Moses&rsquo;s eloquence, and at length commenced discussing it,
      as each man got seated with his pipe in his mouth and his glass on his
      knee, in a little glass-fronted bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man he is to talk, that Sir Moses,&rdquo; observed Buckwheat after a
      long respiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a greet economist of the truth, I reckon,&rdquo; replied Mr. Mossman,
      withdrawing his pipe from his mouth, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve written to him till I&rsquo;m
      tired, about last year&rsquo;s damage to Mrs. Anthill&rsquo;s sown grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s right, though, in saying he never paid for poultry,&rdquo; observed Mr.
      Broadfurrow, with a humorous shake of his big head, &ldquo;but, my word, his
      hook-nosed agent has as many letters as would paper a room;&rdquo; and so they
      sipped, and smoked, and talked the Baronet over, each man feeling
      considerably relieved at there being no fresh attempt on the pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Sir Moses, with the aid of Cuddy Flintoff, trimmed the table,
      and kept the bottles circulating briskly, presently calling on Mr. Paul
      Straddler for a song, who gave them the old heroic one, descriptive of a
      gallant run with the Hit-im and Hold-im shire hounds, in the days of Mr.
      Customer, at which they all laughed and applauded as heartily as if they
      had never heard it before. They then drank Mr. Straddler&rsquo;s health, and
      thanks to him for his excellent song.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it proceeded, Sir Moses intimated quietly to our friend Billy Pringle
      that he should propose his health next, which would enable Mr. Pringle to
      return the compliment by proposing Sir Moses, an announcement that threw
      our hero into a very considerable state of trepidation, but from which he
      saw no mode of escape. Sir Moses then having allowed a due time to elapse
      after the applause that followed the drinking of Mr. Straddler&rsquo;s health,
      again arose, and tapping the table with his hammer, called upon them to
      fill bumpers to the health of his young friend on his right (applause).
      &ldquo;He could not express the pleasure it afforded him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see a
      nephew of his old friend and brother Baronet, Sir Jonathan Pringle, become
      a member of their excellent hunt, and he hoped Billy would long live to
      enjoy the glorious diversion of fox-hunting,&rdquo; which Sir Moses said it was
      the bounden duty of every true-born Briton to support to the utmost of his
      ability, for that it was peculiarly the sport of gentlemen, and about the
      only one that defied the insidious arts of the blackleg, adding that Lord
      Derby was quite right in saying that racing had got into the hands of
      parties who kept horses not for sport, but as mere instruments of
      gambling, and if his (Sir Moses&rsquo;s) young friend, Mr. Pringle, would allow
      him to counsel him, he would say, Never have anything to do with the turf
      (applause). Stick to hunting, and if it didn&rsquo;t bring him in money, it
      would bring him in health, which was better than money, with which
      declaration Sir Moses most cordially proposed Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s health (drunk
      with three times three and one cheer more).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now our friend had never made a speech in his life, but being, as we said
      at the outset, blessed with a great determination of words to the mouth,
      he rose at a hint from Sir Moses, and assured the company &ldquo;how grateful he
      was for the honour they had done him as well in electing him a member of
      their delightful sociable hunt, as in responding to the toast of his
      health in the flattering manner they had, and he could assure them that
      nothing should be wanting on his part to promote the interests of the
      establishment, and to prove himself worthy of their continued good
      opinion,&rdquo; at which intimation Sir Moses winked knowingly at Mr. Smoothley,
      who hemmed a recognition of his meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr. Pringle stood twirling his trifling moustache, wishing to
      sit down, but feeling there was something to keep him up: still he
      couldn&rsquo;t hit it off. Even a friendly round of applause failed to help him
      out; at length, Sir Moses, fearing he might stop altogether, whispered the
      words &ldquo;<i>My health</i>,&rdquo; just under his nose; at which Billy perking up,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, aye, to be sure!&rdquo; and seizing a decanter under him, he
      filled himself a bumper of port, calling upon the company to follow his
      example. This favour being duly accorded, our friend then proceeded, in a
      very limping, halting sort of way, to eulogise a man with whom he was very
      little acquainted amid the friendly word-supplying cheers and plaudits of
      the party. At length he stopped again, still feeling that he was not due
      on his seat, but quite unable to say why he should not resume it. The
      company thinking he might have something to say to the purpose, how he
      meant to hunt with them, or something of that sort, again supplied the
      cheers of encouragement. It was of no use, however, he couldn&rsquo;t hit it
      off.
    </p>
    <h3>
      ****
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>All the honors!</i>&rdquo; at length whispered Sir Moses as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ah, to be sure! <i>all the honors!</i>&rdquo; replied Billy aloud, amidst
      the mirth of the neighbours. &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; continued he, elevating his
      voice to its former pitch, &ldquo;This toast I feel assured&mdash;that is to
      say, I feel quite certain. I mean,&rdquo; stammered he, stamping with his foot,
      &ldquo;I, I, I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Aye, two thou&rsquo;s i&rsquo; Watlington goods!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the half-drunken
      Mr. Corduroys, an announcement that drew forth such a roar of laughter as
      enabled Billy to tack the words, &ldquo;all the honors,&rdquo; to the end, and so with
      elevated glass to continue the noise with cheers. He then sate down
      perfectly satisfied with this his first performance, feeling that he had
      the germs of oratory within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A suitable time having elapsed, Sir Moses rose and returned thanks with
      great vigour, declaring that beyond all comparison that was the proudest
      moment of his life, and that he wouldn&rsquo;t exchange the mastership of the
      Hit-im and Hold-im shire hounds for the highest, the noblest office in the
      world&mdash;Dom&rsquo;d if he would! with which asseveration he drank all their
      very good healths, and resumed his seat amidst loud and long continued
      applause, the timidest then feeling safe against further demands on their
      purses. Another song quickly followed, and then according to the usual
      custom of society, that the more you abuse a man in private the more you
      praise him in public, Sir Moses next proposed the health of that excellent
      and popular nobleman the Earl of Ladythorne, whose splendid pack showed
      such unrivalled sport in the adjoining county of Featherbedford; Sir
      Moses, after a great deal of flattery, concluding by declaring that he
      would &ldquo;go to the world&rsquo;s end to serve Lord Ladythorne&mdash;Dom&rsquo;d if he
      wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; a sort of compliment that the noble Earl never reciprocated; on
      the contrary, indeed, when he condescended to admit the existence of such
      a man as Sir Moses, it was generally in that well-known disparaging
      enquiry, &ldquo;Who <i>is</i> that Sir Aaron Mainchance? or who is that Sir
      Somebody Mainchance, who hunts Hit-im and Hold-im shire?&rdquo; He never could
      hit off the Baronet&rsquo;s Christian or rather Jewish name. Now, however, it
      was all the noble Earl, &ldquo;my noble friend and brother master,&rdquo; the &ldquo;noble
      and gallant sportsman,&rdquo; and so on. Sir Moses thus partly revenging himself
      on his lordship with the freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a master of hounds has to borrow a &ldquo;draw&rdquo; from an adjoining country,
      it is generally a pretty significant hint that his own is exhausted, and
      when the chairman of a hunt dinner begins toasting his natural enemy the
      adjoining master, it is pretty evident that the interest of the evening is
      over. So it was on the present occasion. Broad backs kept bending away at
      intervals, thinking nobody saw them, leaving large gaps unclosed up, while
      the guests that remained merely put a few drops in the bottoms of their
      glasses or passed the bottles altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Aaron, we beg his pardon&mdash;Sir Moses, perceiving this, and knowing
      the value of a good report, called on those who were left to &ldquo;fill a
      bumper to the health of their excellent and truly invaluable friend Mr.
      Pica, contrasting his quiet habits with the swaggering bluster of a
      certain Brummagem Featherbedfordshire D&rsquo;Orsay.&rdquo; (Drunk with great
      applause, D&rsquo;Orsay Davis having more than once sneered at the equestrian
      prowess of the Hit-im aud Hold-im shire-ites.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pica, who was a fisherman and a very bad one to boot, then arose and
      began dribbling out the old stereotyped formula about air we breathe, have
      it not we die, &amp;c., which was a signal for a general rise; not all Sir
      Moses and Cuddy Flintoff&rsquo;s united efforts being able to restrain the
      balance of guests from breaking away, and a squabble occurring behind the
      screen about a hat, the chance was soon irrevocably gone. Mr. Pica was,
      therefore, left alone in his glory. If any one, however, can afford to be
      indifferent about being heard, it is surely an editor who can report
      himself in his paper, and poor Pica did himself ample justice in the
      &ldquo;Hit-im and Hold-im shire Herald&rdquo; on the Saturday following.

      and certainly nothing can be more refreshing after a brawling riotous
      dinner than a little quiet comfortable Bohea. Sir Moses always had his
      six-penn&rsquo;orth, as had a good many of his friends and followers. Indeed the
      rule was a proposition of the Baronet&rsquo;s, such a thing as tea being unheard
      of in the reign of Mr. Customer, or any of Sir Moses&rsquo;s great predecessors.
      Those were the days of &ldquo;lift him up and carry him to bed.&rdquo; Thank goodness

      Mr. Pica&rsquo;s eloquence having rather prematurely dissolved the meeting, Sir

      well pleased with themselves&mdash;each flattering the other in hopes of
      getting a compliment in return. &ldquo;Gone off amazingly well!&rdquo; exclaimed one,
      rubbing his hands in delight at its being over. &ldquo;Capital party,&rdquo; observed

       observed a fifth. &ldquo;O, never fear! Pica&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; rejoined a sixth, and

      The good they do was presently shown on this occasion by Mr. Smoothley,
      the Jackall of the hunt, whose pecuniary obligations to Sir Moses we have
      already hinted at, coming bowing and fawning obsequiously up to our Billy,
      revolving his hands as though he were washing them, and congratulating him
      upon becoming one of them. Mr. Smoothley was what might be called the head
      pacificator of the hunt, the gentleman who coaxed subscriptions,
      deprecated damage, and tried to make young gentlemen believe they had had
      very good runs, when in fact they had only had very middling ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The significant interchange of glances between Sir Moses and him during
      Billy&rsquo;s speech related to a certain cover called Waverley gorse, which the
      young Woolpack, Mr. Treadcroft, who had ascertained his inability to ride,
      had announced his intention of resigning. The custom of the hunt was,
      first to get as many covers as they could for nothing; secondly to quarter
      as few on the club funds as possible; and thirdly to get young gentlemen
      to stand godfathers to covers, in other words to get them to pay the rent
      in return for the compliment of the cover passing by their names, as
      Heslop&rsquo;s spiny, Linch&rsquo;s gorse, Benson&rsquo;s banks, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was generally an after-dinner performance, and required a skilful
      practitioner to accomplish, more particularly as the trick was rather
      notorious. Mr. Smoothley was now about to try his hand on Mr. Pringle. The
      bowing and congratulations over, and the flexible back straightened, he
      commenced by observing that, he supposed a copy of the rules of the hunt
      addressed to Pangburn Park, would find our friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; drawled Billy, wondering if there would be anything to pay. &ldquo;Dash
      it, he wished there mightn&rsquo;t? Shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if there was?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Smoothley, however, gave him little time for reflection, for taking
      hold of one of his own red-coat buttons, he observed, &ldquo;that as he supposed
      Mr. Pringle would be sporting the hunt uniform, he might take the liberty
      of mentioning that Garnett the silversmith in the market-place had by far
      the neatest and best pattern&rsquo;d buttons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Garnett, oh, yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, thinking he would get a set for
      his pink, instead of the plain ones he was wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His shop is next the Lion and the Lamb public house,&rdquo; continued Mr.
      Smoothley, &ldquo;between it and Mrs. Russelton the milliner&rsquo;s, and by the way
      that reminds me,&rdquo; continued he, though we don&rsquo;t exactly see how it could,
      &ldquo;and by the way that reminds me that there is an excellent opportunity for
      distinguishing yourself by adopting the cover young Mr. Treadcroft has
      just abandoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The w-h-a-at?&rdquo; drawled Billy, dreading a &ldquo;do;&rdquo; his mother having
      cautioned him always to be mindful after dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, merely the gorse,&rdquo; continued Mr. Smoothley, in the most affable
      matter-of-course way imaginable, &ldquo;merely the gorse&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll step
      this way, I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; continued he, leading the way to where a large
      dirty board was suspended against the wall below the portrait of Lord
      Martingal on his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now he&rsquo;s running into him!</i>&rdquo; muttered Sir Moses to himself, his
      keen eye supplying the words to the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, you see,&rdquo; explained Mr. Smoothley, hitching the board off its
      brass-headed nail, and holding it to the light&mdash;&ldquo;this, you see, is a
      list of all the covers in the country&mdash;Screechley, Summer-field,
      Reddingfield, Bewley, Lanton Hill, Baxterley, and so forth. Then you see
      here,&rdquo; continned he, pointing to a ruled column opposite, &ldquo;are the names
      of the owners or patrons&mdash;yes&rdquo; (reading), &ldquo;owners or patrons&mdash;Lord
      Oilcake, Lord Polkaton, Sir Harry Fuzball, Mr. Heslop, Lord Harpsichord,
      Mr. Drew, Mr. Smith. Now young Mr. Treadcroft, who has had as many falls
      as he likes, and perhaps more, has just announced his intention of
      retiring and giving up this cover,&rdquo; pointing to Waverley, with Mr.
      Treadcroft, Jun.&lsquo;s name opposite to it, &ldquo;and it struck me that it would be
      a capital opportunity for you who have just joined us, to take it before
      anybody knows, and then it will go by the name of Pringle&rsquo;s gorse, and
      you&rsquo;ll get the credit of all the fine runs that take place from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-a-r-s-e,&rdquo; drawled Billy, thinking that that would be a sharp thing to
      do, and that it would be fine to rank with the lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Mr. Smoothley, taking the answer for an assent, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      just strike Treadey&rsquo;s name ont, and put yours in;&rdquo; so saying, he darted at
      the sideboard, and seizing an old ink-clotted stump of a pen, with just
      enough go in it to make the required alteration, and substituted Mr.
      Pringle&rsquo;s name for that of Mr. Treadcroft. And so, what with his cover,
      his dinner, and his button, poor Billy was eased of above twenty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Sir Moses was blowing his beak, stirring the fire, and chuckling
      at the success of the venture, a gingling of cups and tinkling of spoons
      was heard in the distance, and presently a great flight of tea-trays
      emerged from either side of the screen, conspicuous among the bearers of
      which were the tall ticket-of-leave butler and the hirsute Monsieur Jean
      Rougier. These worthies, with a few other &ldquo;gentlemen&rsquo;s gentlemen,&rdquo; had
      been regaled to a supper in the &ldquo;Blenheim,&rdquo; to which Peter had contributed
      a liberal allowance of hunt wine, the consumption of which was checked by
      the corks, one set, it was said, serving Peter the season. That that which
      is everybody&rsquo;s business is nobody&rsquo;s, is well exemplified in these sort of
      transactions, for though a member of the hunt went through the form of
      counting the cork-tops every evening, and seeing that they corresponded
      with the number set down in Peter&rsquo;s book, nobody ever compared the book
      with the cellar, so that in fact Peter was both check-keeper and auditor.
      Public bodies, however, are all considered fair game, and the Hit-im and
      Hold-im shire hunt was no exception to the rule. In addition to the wine,
      there had been a sufficient allowance of spirits in the &ldquo;Blenheim&rdquo; to set
      the drunkards to work on their own account, and Jack Rogers, who was quite
      the life of the party, was very forward in condition when the tea-summons
      was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cried Peter, holding up his hand, and listening to an ominous
      bell-peal, &ldquo;I do believe that&rsquo;s for tea! So it is,&rdquo; sighed he, as a second
      summons broke upon the ear. &ldquo;Tea at this hour!&rdquo; ejaculated he, &ldquo;who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; 
      thought it twenty years ago! Why, this is just the time they&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been
      calling for Magnums, and beginnin&rsquo; the evening&mdash;<i>Tea!</i> They&rsquo;d as
      soon ha&rsquo; thought of callin&rsquo; for winegar!&rdquo; added he, with a bitter sneer.
      So saying, Peter dashed a tear from his aged eye, and rising from his
      chair, craved the assistance of his guests to carry the degrading beverage
      up-stairs, to our degenerate party. &ldquo;A set of weshenvomen!&rdquo; muttered he,
      as the great slop-basin-like-cups stood ranged on trays along the
      kitchen-table ready for conveyance. &ldquo;Sarves us right for allowing such a
      chap to take our country,&rdquo; added he, adopting his load, and leading the
      tea-van.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the soothing, smoking beverage entered, our friend, Cuddy Flintoff,
      was &ldquo;yoicking&rdquo; himself about the club-room, stopping now at this picture,
      now that, holloaing at one, view-holloaing at another, thus airing his
      hunting noises generally, as each successive subject recalled some lively
      association in his too sensitive hunting imagination. Passing from the
      contemplation of that great work of art, Mr. Customer getting drunk, he
      suddenly confronted the tea-brigade entering, led by Peter, Monsieur, and
      the ticket-of-leave butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloa! old Bushey Heath!&rdquo; exclaimed Cuddy, dapping his hands, as
      Mousieur&rsquo;s frizzed face loomed congruously behind a muffin-towering
      tea-tray. &ldquo;Holloa! old Bushey Heath!&rdquo; repeated he, louder than before, &ldquo;<i>What
      cheer there?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vot cheer there, Brother Bareacres?&rdquo; replied Jack in the same familiar
      tone, to the great consternation of Cuddy, and the amusement of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dash the fellow! but he&rsquo;s getting bumptious,&rdquo; muttered Cuddy, who had no
      notion of being taken up that way by a servant. &ldquo;Dash the fellow! but he&rsquo;s
      getting bumptious,&rdquo; repeated he, adding aloud to Jack, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way
      you talked when you tumbled off your horse the other day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tombled off my &lsquo;oss, sare!&rdquo; replied Jack, indignantly&mdash;&ldquo;tombled off
      my &lsquo;oss, sare&mdash;nevare, sare!&mdash;nevare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; retorted Cuddy, &ldquo;do you mean to say you didn&rsquo;t tumble off your
      horse on the Crooked Billet day?&rdquo; for Cuddy had heard of that exploit, but
      not of Jack&rsquo;s subsequent performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sare, I jomp off,&rdquo; replied Jack, thinking Cuddy alluded to his change
      of horses with the Woolpack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Jo-o-m-p</i> off! j-o-omp off!&rdquo; reiterated Cuddy, &ldquo;we all jomp off,
      when we can&rsquo;t keep on. Why didn&rsquo;t old Imperial John take you into the
      Crooked Billet, and scrape you, and cherish you, and comfort you, and
      treat you as he would his own son?&rdquo; demanded Cuddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imperial John, sare, nevare did nothin&rsquo; of the sort,&rdquo; replied Jack,
      confidently. &ldquo;Imperial John and I retired to &lsquo;ave leetle drop drink
      together to our better &lsquo;quaintance. I met John there, <i>n&rsquo;est-ce pas?</i>
      Monsieur Sare Moses, Baronet! Vasn&rsquo;t it as I say?&rdquo; asked Jack, jingling
      his tea-tray before the Baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh yes, undoubtedly; I introduced you
      there; but here! let me have some tea,&rdquo; continued he, taking a cup,
      wishing to stop the conversation, lest Lord Ladythorne might hear he had
      introduced his right-hand man, Imperial John, to a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuddy, however, wasn&rsquo;t to be stopped. He was sure Jack had tumbled off,
      and was bent upon working him in return for his Bareacres compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but tell us,&rdquo; said he, addressing Jack again, &ldquo;did you come over
      his head or his tail, when you jomp off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Cuddy! don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; now muttered Sir Moses, taking the entire top tier
      off a pile of muffins, and filling his mouth as full as it would hold;
      &ldquo;don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; repeated he, adding, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use (munch) bullying a poor
      (crunch) beggar because he&rsquo;s a (munch) Frenchman&rdquo; (crunch). Sir Moses then
      took a great draught of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur&rsquo;s monkey, however, was now up, and he felt inclined to tackle
      with Flintoff. &ldquo;I tell you vot, sare Cuddy,&rdquo; said he, looking him full in
      the face, &ldquo;you think yourself vare great man, vare great ossmaan, vare
      great foxer, and so on, bot I vill ride you a match for vot monies you
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoo-ray! well done you! go it, Monsieur! Who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought it! Now for
      some fun!&rdquo; resounded through the room, bringing all parties in closer
      proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flintoff was rather taken aback. He didn&rsquo;t expect anything of that sort,
      and though he fully believed Jack to be a tailor, he didn&rsquo;t want to test
      the fact himself; indeed he felt safer on foot than on horseback, being
      fonder of the theory than of the reality of hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hut you and your matches,&rdquo; sneered he, thrusting his hands deep in his
      trousers&rsquo; pockets, inclining to sheer of, adding, &ldquo;go and get his Imperial
      Highness to ride you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Imperial Highness, sare, don&rsquo;t deal in oss matches. He is not a
      jockey, he is a gentlemans&mdash;great friend of de great lords vot rules
      de oder noisy dogs,&rdquo; replied Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Humph</i>, grunted Sir Moses, not liking the language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In-deed!&rdquo; exclaimed Cuddy with a frown, &ldquo;In-deed! Hark to Monsieur!
      Hark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, make him a match, Cuddy! make him a match!&rdquo; now interposed Paul
      Straddler, closing up to prevent Cuddy&rsquo;s retreat. Paul, as we said before,
      was a disengaged gentleman who kept a house of call for Bores at Hinton,&mdash;a
      man who was always ready to deal, or do anything, or go any where at any
      body else&rsquo;s expense. A great judge of a horse, a great judge of a groom, a
      great judge of a gig, a gentleman a good deal in Cuddy Flintoff&rsquo;s own line
      in short, and of course not a great admirer of his. He now thought he saw
      his way to a catch, for the Woolpack had told him how shamefully Jack had
      bucketed his horse, and altogether he thought Monsieur might be as good a
      man across country as Mr. Flintoff. At all events he would like to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, make him a match, Cuddy! make him a match!&rdquo; now exclaimed he, adding
      in Flintoff&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;never let it be said you were afraid of a Frenchman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; sneered Cuddy, &ldquo;nobody who knows me will think that, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, <i>make</i> him a match!&rdquo; urged Tommy Heslop, who was no great
      admirer of Cuddy&rsquo;s either; &ldquo;<i>make</i> him a match, and I&rsquo;ll go your
      halves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go Monsieur&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mr. Straddler, still backing the thing up.
      Thus appealed to, poor Cuddv was obliged to submit, and before he knew
      where he was, the dread pen, ink and paper were produced, and things began
      to assume a tangible form. Mr. Paul Straddler, having seated himself on a
      chair at the opportune card-table, began sinking his pen and smoothing out
      his paper, trying to coax his ideas into order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let us see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;now let us see. Monsieur, what&rsquo;s his name&mdash;old
      Bushey-heath as you call him, agrees to ride Mr. Flintoff a match across
      country&mdash;now for distance, time, and stake! now for distance, time,
      and stake!&rdquo; added he, hitting off the scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but how can you make a match without any horses? how can you make a
      match without any horses?&rdquo; asked Sir Moses, interposing his beak, adding
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not lend any&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if I will.&rdquo; That being the first time Sir
      Moses was ever known not to volunteer one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;ll find horses,&rdquo; replied Tommy Heslop, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll find horses!&rdquo;
       thinking Sir Moses&rsquo;s refusal was all in favor of the match. &ldquo;Catch
      weights, catch horses, catch every thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for distance, time, and stake,&rdquo; reiterated Mr. Straddler. &ldquo;Now for
      distance, time, and stake, Monsieur!&rdquo; continued he, appealing to Jack.
      &ldquo;What distance would you like to have it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vot you please, sare,&rdquo; replied Monsieur, now depositing his tray on the
      sideboard; &ldquo;vot you please, sare, much or little; ten miles, twenty miles,
      any miles he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, the fellow&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; muttered Cuddy, with a jerk of his head, making a
      last effort to be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry, Cuddy, don&rsquo;t be in a hurry,&rdquo; interposed Heslop,
      adding, &ldquo;he doesn&rsquo;t understand it&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I understands it, nicely, vell enough,&rdquo; replied Jack, with a shrug of
      his shoulders; &ldquo;put us on to two orses, and see vich gets first to de
      money post.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, yes, exactly, to be sure, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; asserted Paul
      Straddler, looking up approvingly at Jack, &ldquo;and you say you&rsquo;ll beat Mr.
      Flintoff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say I beat Mr. Flintoff,&rdquo; rejoined Jack&mdash;&ldquo;beat im dem vell too&mdash;beat
      his ead off&mdash;beat him <i>stupendous!</i>&rdquo; added he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, dash it all, we can&rsquo;t stand that, Caddy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Heslop,
      nudging Mr. Flintoff; &ldquo;honor of the country, honor of the hunt, honor of
      England, honor of every thing&rsquo;s involved.&rdquo; Cuddy&rsquo;s bristles were now up
      too, and shaking his head and thrusting his hands deep into his trousers
      pockets, &ldquo;he declared he couldn&rsquo;t stand that sort of language,&mdash;shot
      if he could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nor nobody else,&rdquo; continued Mr. Heslop, keeping him up to the
      indignity mark; &ldquo;must be taught better manners,&rdquo; added he with a pout of
      the lip, as though fully espousing Caddy&rsquo;s cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then! come along!&rdquo; cried Paul Straddler, flourishing his
      dirty pen; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s set up a school for grown sportsmen. Now for the good
      boys. Master Bushey-heath says he&rsquo;ll ride Master Bareacres a match across
      country&mdash;two miles say&mdash;for, for, how much?&rdquo; asked he, looking
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      This caused a pause, as it often does, even after dinner, and not the less
      so in the present instance, inasmuch as the promoters of the match had
      each a share in the risk. What would be hundreds in other people&rsquo;s cases
      becomes pounds in our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flintoff and Straddler looked pacifically at each other, as much as to
      say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use in cutting each other&rsquo;s throats, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we say,&rdquo; (exhibiting four fingers and a thumb, slyly to indicate
      a five pound note), said Heslop demurely, after a conference with Cuddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; asserted Straddler, &ldquo;glad it was no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And call it fifty,&rdquo; whispered Heslop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly!&rdquo; assented Straddler, &ldquo;very proper arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two miles for fifty pounds,&rdquo; announced Straddler, writing it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. P. I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo; observed he, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P. P.&rdquo; assented Heslop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what next?&rdquo; asked Paul, feeling that there was something more
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An umpire,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Smoothley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, to be sure, an umpire,&rdquo; replied Mr. Straddler; &ldquo;who shall it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Moses!&rdquo; suggested several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Moses, by all means,&rdquo; replied Straddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Content,&rdquo; nodded Mr. Heslop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be on a non-hunting day, then,&rdquo; observed the Baronet, speaking
      from the bottom of his tea-cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Non-hunting day!&rdquo; repeated Cuddy; &ldquo;non-hunting day; fear that &lsquo;ill not do&mdash;want
      to be off to town on Friday to see Tommy White&rsquo;s horses sold. Have been
      above a week at the Park, as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a fortnight to-morrow, sir,&rdquo; observed the ticket-of-leave
      butler (who had just come to announce the carriage) in a very different
      tone to his usual urbane whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortnight to-morrow, have I?&rdquo; rejoined Cuddy sheepishly; &ldquo;greater reason
      why I should be off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, never think about that! O, never think about that! Heartily welcome,
      heartily welcome,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Moses, stuffing his mouth full of muffin,
      adding &ldquo;Mr. Pringle will keep you company; Mr. Pringle will keep you
      company.&rdquo; (Hunch, munch, crunch.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Pringle <i>must</i> stop,&rdquo; observed Mr. Straddler, &ldquo;unless he goes
      without his man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To besure he must,&rdquo; assented Sir Moses, &ldquo;to be sure he must,&rdquo; adding,
      &ldquo;stop as long as ever you like. I&rsquo;ve no engagement till Saturday&mdash;no
      engagement till Saturday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now putting off our friend&rsquo;s departure till Saturday just gave a clear day
      for the steeple-chase, the next one, Thursday, being Woolerton by
      Heckfield, Saturday the usual make-believe day at the kennels; so of
      course Friday was fixed upon, and Sir Moses having named &ldquo;noon&rdquo; as the
      hour, and Timberlake toll-bar as the <i>rendezvous</i>, commenced a series
      of adieus as he beat a retreat to the screen, where having resumed his
      wraps, and gathered his tail, he shot down-stairs, and was presently
      re-ensconced in his carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remanets then of course proceeded to talk him and his friends over,
      some wishing the Baronet mightn&rsquo;t be too many for Billy, others again
      thinking Cuddy wasn&rsquo;t altogether the most desirable acquaintance a young
      man could have, though there wasn&rsquo;t one that didn&rsquo;t think that he himself
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      That topic being at length exhausted, they then discussed the projected
      steeple-chase, some thinking that Cuddy was a muff, others that Jack was,
      some again thinking they both were. And as successive relays of hot brandy
      and water enabled them to see matters more clearly, the Englishman&rsquo;s
      argument of betting was introduced, and closed towards morning at &ldquo;evens,&rdquo;
       either jockey for choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now take a look at the homeward bound party.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was lucky for Billy that the night was dark and the road rough with
      newly laid whinstones, for both Sir Moses and Cuddy opened upon him most
      volubly and vehemently as soon as ever they got off the uneven pavement,
      with no end of inquiries about Jack and his antecedents. If he could ride?
      If he had ever seen him ride? If he had ever ridden a steeplechase? Where
      he got him? How long he had had him?
    </p>
    <p>
      To most of which questions, Billy replied with his usual monosyllabic
      drawling, &ldquo;yarses,&rdquo; amid jolts, and grinds, and gratings, and doms from
      Sir Moses, and cusses from Cuddy, easing his conscience with regard to
      Jack&rsquo;s service, by saying that he had had him &ldquo;some time.&rdquo; Some time! What
      a fine elastic period that is. We&rsquo;d back a lawyer to make it cover a
      century or a season. Very little definite information, however, did they
      extract from Billy with regard to Jack for the best of all reasons, that
      Billy didn&rsquo;t know anything. Both Cuddy and Sir Moses interpreted his
      ignorance differently, and wished he mightn&rsquo;t know more than was good for
      them. And so in the midst of roughs and smooths, and jolts and jumps, and
      examinings, and cross-examinings, and re-examinings, they at length
      reached Pangburn Park Lodges, and were presently at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast at eight!&rdquo; said Sir Moses to Bankhead, as he alighted from the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast at eight, Pringle!&rdquo; repeated he, and seizing a flat candlestick
      from the half-drunken footman in the passage, he hurried up-stairs,
      blowing his beak with great vigour to drown any appeal to him about a
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He little knew how unlikely our young friend was to trouble him in that
      way.

      CHAPTER XLII.<br/>MR. GEORDEY GALLON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>UDDY Flintoff did
      not awake at all comfortable the next morning, and he distinctly traced
      the old copyhead of &ldquo;Familiarity breeds contempt,&rdquo; in the hieroglyphic
      pattern of his old chintz bed-hangings. He couldn&rsquo;t think how he could
      ever be so foolish as to lay himself open to such a catastrophe; it was
      just the wine being in and the wit being out, coupled with the fact of the
      man being a Frenchman, that led him away&mdash;and he most devoutly wished
      he was well out of the scrape. Suppose Monsieur was a top sawyer! Suppose
      he was a regular steeple-chaser! Suppose he was a second Beecher in
      disguise! It didn&rsquo;t follow because he was a Frenchman that he couldn&rsquo;t
      ride. Altogether Mr. Flintoff repented. It wasn&rsquo;t nice amusement,
      steeple-chasing he thought, and the quicksilver of youth had departed from
      him; getting called Bareacres, too, was derogatory, and what no English
      servant would have done, if even he had called him Bushy Heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy Pringle, on the other hand, was very comfortable, and slept soundly,
      regardless of clubs, cover rents, over-night consequences, altogether.
      Each having desired to be called when the other got up, they stood a
      chance of lying in bed all day, had not Mrs. Margerum, fearing they would
      run their breakfast, and the servants&rsquo;-hall dinner together, despatched
      Monsieur and the footman with their respective hot-water cans, to say the
      other had risen. It was eleven o&rsquo;clock ere they got dawdled down-stairs,
      and Cuddy again began demanding this and that delicacy in the name of Mr.
      Pringle: Mr. Pringle wanted Yorkshire pie; Mr. Pringle wanted potted
      prawns; Mr. Pringle wanted bantams&rsquo; eggs; Mr. Pringle wanted honey. Why
      the deuce didn&rsquo;t they attend to Mr. Pringle?
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast was presently interrupted by the sound of wheels, and almost
      ere they had ceased to revolve, a brisk pull at the doorbell aroused the
      inmates of both the front and back regions, and brought the hurrying
      footman, settling himself into his yellow-edged blue-livery coat as he
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Heslop. Heslop in a muffin cap, and so disguised in
      heather-coloured tweed, that Mr. Pringle failed to recognise him as he
      entered. Cuddy did, though; and greeting him with one of his best view
      holloas, he invited him to sit down and partake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heslop was an early bird, and had broke his fast hours before: but a
      little more breakfast being neither here nor there, he did as he was
      requested, though he would much rather have found Cuddy alone. He wanted
      to talk to him about the match, to hear if Sir Moses had said anything
      about the line of country, what sort of a horse he would like to ride, and
      so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy went munch, munch, munching on, in the tiresome, pertinacious sort
      of way people do when others are anxiously wishing them done,&mdash;now
      taking a sip of tea, now a bit of toast, now another egg, now looking as
      if he didn&rsquo;t know what he would take. Heslop inwardly wished him at
      Jericho. At length another sound of wheels was heard, followed by another
      peal of the bell; and our hero presently had a visitor, too, in the person
      of Mr. Paul Straddler. Paul had come on the same sort of errand as Heslop,
      namely, to arrange matters about Monsieur; and Heslop and he, seeing how
      the land lay, Heslop asked Cuddy if there was any one in Sir Moses&rsquo;s
      study; whereupon Cuddy arose and led the way to the sunless little
      sanctum, where Sir Moses kept his other hat, his other boots, his rows of
      shoes, his beloved but rather empty cash-box, and the plans and papers of
      the Pangburn Park estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two anxious deliberations then ensued in the study and breakfast-room, in
      the course of which Monsieur was summoned into the presence of either
      party, and retired, leaving them about as wise as he found them. He
      declared he could ride, ride &ldquo;dem vell too,&rdquo; and told Paul he could &ldquo;beat
      Cuddy&rsquo;s head off;&rdquo; but he accompanied the assertions with such wild,
      incoherent arguments, and talked just as he did to Imperial John before
      the Crooked Billet, that they thought it was all gasconade. If it hadn&rsquo;t
      been P. P., Paul would have been off. Cuddy, on the other hand, gained
      courage; and as Heslop proposed putting him on his famous horse General
      Havelock, the reported best fencer in the country, Cuddy, who wasn&rsquo;t
      afraid of pace, hoped to be able to give a good account of himself.
      Indeed, he so far recovered his confidence, as to indulge in a few hunting
      noises&mdash;&ldquo;<i>For-rard, on! For-rard on!</i>&rdquo; cheered he, as if he was
      leading the way with the race well in hand.

    <p>
      Meanwhile Monsieur, who could keep his own counsel, communicated by a
      certain mysterious agency that prevails in most countries, and seems to
      rival the electric telegraph in point of speed, to enlist a confederate in
      his service. This was Mr. Geordey Gallon, a genius carrying on the trades
      of poacher, pugilist, and publican, under favour of that mistaken piece of
      legislation the Beer Act. Geordey, like Jack, had begun life as a
      post-boy, and like him had undergone various vicissitudes ere he finally
      settled down to the respectable calling we have named. He now occupied the
      Rose and Crown beershop at the Four Lane-Ends, on the Heatherbell Road,
      some fifteen miles from Pangburn Park, where, in addition to his regular
      or irregular calling, he generally kept a racing-like runaway, that
      whisked a light spring-cart through the country by night, freighted with
      pigeons, poultry, game, dripping&mdash;which latter item our readers
      doubtless know includes every article of culinary or domestic use. He was
      also a purveyor of lead, lead-stealing being now one of the liberal
      professions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geordey had had a fine time of it, for the Hit-im and Hold-im shire
      constables were stupid and lazy, and when the short-lived Superintendent
      ones were appointed, it was only a trifle in his way to suborn them. So he
      made hay while the sun shone, and presently set up a basket-buttoned green
      cutaway for Sundays, in lieu of the baggy pocketed, velveteen
      shooting-jacket of week-days, and replaced the fox-skin cap with a bare
      shallow drab, with a broad brim, and a black band, encasing his
      substantial in cords and mahogany tops, instead of the navvie boot that
      laced his great bulging calves into globes. He then called himself a
      sporting man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a fair, not a fight, not a fray of any sort, but Geordey&rsquo;s great
      square bull-headed carcase was there, and he was always ready to run his
      nag, or trot his nag, or match his nag in any shape or way&mdash;Mr.
      George Gallon&rsquo;s Blue Ruin, Mr. George Gallon&rsquo;s Flower of the West, Mr.
      George Gallon&rsquo;s Honor Bright, will be names familiar to most lovers of
      leather-plating. * Besides this, he did business in a smaller way. Being a
      pure patriot, he was a great promoter of the sports and pastimes of the
      people, and always travelled with a prospectus in his pocket of some
      raffle for a watch, some shooting-match for a fat hog, some dog or some
      horse to be disposed of in a surreptitious way, one of the conditions
      always being, that a certain sum was to be spent by the winner at Mr.
      Gallon&rsquo;s, of the Hose and Crown, at the Four Lane-ends on the Heatherbell
      Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the worthy selected by Monsieur Rougier to guard his interests in
      the matter. But how the communication was made, or what were the
      instructions given, those who are acquainted with the wheels within
      wheels, and the glorious mystification that prevails in all matters
      relating to racing or robbing, will know the impossibility of narrating.
      Even Sir Moses was infected with the prevailing epidemic, and returned
      from hunting greatly subdued in loquacity. He wanted to be on for a £5 or
      two, but couldn&rsquo;t for the life of him make out which was to be the right
      side. So he was very chary of his wine after dinner, and wouldn&rsquo;t let
      Cuddy have any brandy at bed-time&mdash;&ldquo;Dom&rsquo;d if he would.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XLIII.<br/>SIR MOSES PERPLEXED&mdash;THE RENDEZVOUS FOR THE RACE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE great event was
      ushered in by one of those fine bright autumnal days that shame many
      summer ones, and seem inclined to carry the winter months fairly over into
      the coming year. The sun rose with effulgent radiance, gilding the
      lingering brown and yellow tints, and lighting up the landscape with
      searching, inquisitorial scrutiny. Not a nook, not a dell, not a cot, not
      a curl of smoke but was visible, and the whole scene shone with the vigour
      of a newly burnished, newly varnished picture. The cattle stood in bold
      relief against the perennially green fields, and the newly dipped lambs
      dotted the hill-sides like white marbles. A clear bright light gleamed
      through the stems of the Scotch fir belt, encircling the brow of High Rays
      Hill, giving goodly promise of continued fineness.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
* We append one of Mr. Gallon&rsquo;s advertisements for a horse,
which is very characteristic of the man:&mdash;

&ldquo;A Flash high-stepping SCREW WANTED. Must be very fast,
steady in single harness, and the price moderate. Blemishes
no object. Apply, by letter, real name and address, with
full description, to Mr. George Gallon, Rose and Crown,
Four-Lane-ends. Hit-im and Hold-im shire.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Sir Moses, seeing this harbinger of fair from his window as he dressed,
      arrayed himself in his best attire, securing his new blue and white satin
      cravat with a couple of massive blood-stone pins, and lacing his
      broad-striped vest with a multiplicity of chains and appendant gew-gaws.
      He further dared the elements with an extensive turning up of velvet.
      Altogether he was a great swell, and extremely well pleased with his
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inmates of the Park were all at sixes and sevens that morning,
      Monsieur having left Billy to be valeted by the footman, whose services
      were entirely monopolised by Cuddy Flintoff and Sir Moses. When he did at
      length come, he replied to Billy&rsquo;s enquiry &ldquo;how his horse was,&rdquo; that he
      was &ldquo;quite well,&rdquo; which was satisfactory to our friend, and confirmed him
      in his opinion of the superiority of his judgment over that of Wetun and
      the rest. Sir Moses, however, who had made the tour of the stables,
      thought otherwise, and telling the Tiger to put the footboard to the back
      of the dog-cart, reserved the other place in front for his guest. A
      tremendous hurry Sir Moses was in to be off, rushing in every two or three
      minutes to see if Billy wasn&rsquo;t done his breakfast, and at last ordering
      round the vehicle to expedite his movements. Then he went to the door and
      gave the bell such a furious ring as sounded through the house and seemed
      well calculated to last for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy then came, hustled along by the ticket-of-leave butler and the
      excitable footman, who kept dressing him as he went; and putting his mits,
      his gloves, his shawl, cravat, and his taper umbrella into his hands,
      they helped him up to the seat by Sir Moses, who forthwith soused him
      down, by touching the mare with the whip, and starting off at a pace that
      looked like trying to catch an express train. Round flew the wheels, up
      shot the yellow mud, open went the lodge gates, bark went the curs, and
      they were presently among the darker mud of the Marshfield and Greyridge
      Hill Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      On, on, Sir Moses pushed, as if in extremis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, how is it to be?&rdquo; at length asked he, getting his mare more by
      the head, after grinding through a long strip of newly-laid whinstone:
      &ldquo;How is it to be? Can this beggar of yours ride, or can he not?&rdquo; Sir Moses
      looking with a scrutinising eye at Billy as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse, he can ride,&rdquo; replied Billy, feeling his collar; &ldquo;rode the other
      day, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>. &ldquo;Ah, but that&rsquo;s not the sort of riding I mean. Can he
      ride across country? Can he ride a steeple-chase, in fact?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Pringle</i>. &ldquo;Yarse, I should say he could,&rdquo; hesitated our friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>. &ldquo;Well, but it won&rsquo;t do to back a man to do a thing one
      isn&rsquo;t certain he can do, you know. Now, between ourselves,&rdquo; continued he,
      lowering his voice so as not to let the Tiger hear&mdash;&ldquo;Cuddy Flintoff
      is no great performer&mdash;more of a mahogany sportsman than any thing
      else, and it wouldn&rsquo;t take any great hand to beat him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy couldn&rsquo;t say whether Monsieur was equal to the undertaking or not,
      and therefore made no reply. This perplexed Sir Moses, who wished that
      Billy&rsquo;s downy face mightn&rsquo;t contain more mischief than it ought. It would
      be a devil of a bore, he thought, to be done by such a boy. So he again
      took the mare short by the head, and gave expression to his thoughts by
      the whip along her sides. Thus he shot down Walkup Hill at a pace that
      carried him half way up the opposing one. Still he couldn&rsquo;t see his way&mdash;dom&rsquo;d
      if he could&mdash;and he felt half inclined not to risk his &ldquo;fi-pun&rdquo; note.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this hesitating mood he came within sight of the now crowd-studded
      rendezvous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timberlake toll bar, the rendezvous for the race, stands on the summit of
      the hog-backed Wooley Hill, famous for its frequent sheep-fairs, and
      commands a fine view over the cream of the west side of
      Featherbedfordshire, and by no means the worst part of the land of Jewdea,
      as the wags of the former country call Hit-im and Hold-im shire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses had wisely chosen this rendezvous, in order that he might give
      Lord Ladythorne the benefit of the unwelcome intrusion without exciting
      the suspicion of the farmers, who would naturally suppose that the match
      would take place over some part of Sir Moses&rsquo;s own country. In that,
      however, they had reckoned without their host. Sir Moses wasn&rsquo;t the man to
      throw a chance away&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road, after crossing the bridge over Bendibus Burn, being all against
      collar, Sir Moses dropped his reins, and sitting back in his seat,
      proceeded to contemplate the crowd. A great gathering there was, horsemen,
      footmen, gigmen, assmen, with here and there a tinkling-belled
      liquor-vending female, a tossing pie-man, or a nut-merchant. As yet the
      spirit of speculation was not aroused, and the people gathered in groups,
      looking as moody as men generally do who want to get the better of each
      other. The only cheerful faces on the scene were those of Toney Loftus,
      the pike-man, and his wife, whose neat white-washed, stone-roofed cottage
      was not much accustomed to company, save on the occasion of the fairs.
      They were now gathering their pence and having a let-off for their long
      pent-up gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses&rsquo;s approach put a little liveliness into the scene, and satisfied
      the grumbling or sceptical ones that they had not come to the wrong place.
      There was then a general move towards the great white gate, and as he paid
      his fourpence the nods of recognition and How are ye&rsquo;s? commenced amid a
      vigorous salute of the muffin bells. <i>Tinkle tinkle tinkle, buy buy buy</i>,
      toss and try! toss and try! <i>tinkle tinkle tinkle</i>. Barcelona nuts,
      crack &rsquo;em and try &rsquo;em, crack &rsquo;em and try &rsquo;em; the invitation being
      accompanied with the rattle of a few in the little tin can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, where are the jockeys?&rdquo; asked Sir Moses, straining his eye-balls
      over the open downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coomin. Sir Moses, they&rsquo;re coomin,&rdquo; replied several voices; and
      as they spoke, a gaily-dressed man, on a milk-white horse, emerged from
      the little fold-yard of Butterby farm, about half a mile to the west,
      followed by two distinct groups of mounted and dismounted companions, who
      clustered round either champion like electors round a candidate going to
      the hustings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Geordey Gallon!&rdquo; was now the cry, as the hero of the white horse
      shot away from the foremost group, and came best pace across the
      rush-grown sward of the sheep-walk towards the toll-bar. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Geordey
      Gallon! and now we shall hear summut about it;&rdquo; whereupon the scattered
      groups began to mingle and turn in the direction of the coming man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Gallon,&mdash;Gallon on his famous trotting hack Tippy Tom&mdash;a
      vicious runaway brute, that required constant work to keep it under, a
      want that Mr. Gallon liberally supplied it with. It now came yawning and
      boring on the bit, one ear lying one way, the other another, shaking its
      head like a terrier with a rat in its mouth, with a sort of air that as
      good as said. &ldquo;Let me go, or I&rsquo;ll either knock your teeth down your throat
      with my head, or come back over upon you.&rdquo; So Mr. Gallon let him go, and
      came careering along at a leg-stuck-out sort of butcher&rsquo;s shuffle, one
      hand grasping the weather-bleached reins, the other a cutting-whip, his
      green coat-laps and red kerchief ends lying out, his baggy white cords and
      purple plush waistcoat strings all in a flutter, looking as if he was
      going to bear away the gate and house, Toney Loftus and wife, all before
      him. Fortunately for the byestanders there was plenty of space, which,
      coupled with the deep holding ground and Mr. Gallon&rsquo;s ample weight&mdash;good
      sixteen stone&mdash;enabled him to bring the white nag to its bearings;
      and after charging a flock of geese, and nearly knocking down a
      Barcelona-nut merchant, he got him manoeuvred in a semicircular sort of
      way up to the gate, just as if it was all right and plain sailing. He then
      steadied him with a severe double-handed jerk of the bit, coupled with one
      of those deep ominous <i>wh-o-o ah&rsquo;s</i> that always preceded a hiding.
      Tippy Tom dropped his head as if he understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were now anxiously scrutinising Gallon&rsquo;s great rubicund
      double-chinned visage, for, in addition to his general sporting knowledge
      and acquirements, he was just fresh from the scene of action where he had
      doubtless been able to form an opinion. Even Sir Moses, who hated the
      sight of him, and always declared he &ldquo;ought to be hung,&rdquo; vouchsafed him a
      &ldquo;good morning, Gallon,&rdquo; which the latter returned with a familiar nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then composed himself in his capacious old saddle, and taking off his
      white shallow began mopping his great bald head, hoping that some one
      would sound the key-note of speculation ere the advancing parties arrived
      at the gate. They all, however, seemed to wish to defer to Mr. Gallon&mdash;Gallon
      was the man for their money, Gallon knew a thing or two, Gallon was up to
      snuff,&mdash;go it, Gallon!
    </p>
    <h3>
      ****
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does onybody say &lsquo;boot it Frenchman?&rdquo; at length asked he in his
      elliptical Yorkshire dialect, looking round on the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say &lsquo;boot it Frenchman, Sir Moses?&rdquo; asked he, not getting an
      answer from any one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, I know nothing,&rdquo; replied the Baronet, with a slight curl of the
      lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, yeer tied to know summut, hooever,&rdquo; replied Gallon, rubbing his nose
      across the back of his hand; &ldquo;yeer tied to know summut, hooever. Why, he&rsquo;s
      a stoppin&rsquo; at yeer house, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may all be,&rdquo; rejoined Sir Moses, &ldquo;without my knowing anything of his
      riding. What do you say yourself? you&rsquo;ve seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen him!&rdquo; retorted Gallon, &ldquo;why he&rsquo;s a queer lookin&rsquo; chap, ony hoo&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      all ar can say: haw, haw, haw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t back him, then?&rdquo; said Sir Moses, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly that,&rdquo; replied Gallon, shaking his head and laughing heartily,
      &ldquo;hardly that, Sir Moses. Ar&rsquo;ll tell you whatar&rsquo;ll do, though,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;just to mak sport luike, ar&rsquo;ll tak yeer two to one&mdash;two croons to
      one,&rdquo; producing a greasy-looking metallic-pencilled betting-book as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a move outside the ring announced an arrival, and presently Mr.
      Heslop came steering Cuddy Flintoff along in his wife&rsquo;s Croydon
      basket-carriage, Cuddy&rsquo;s head docked in an orange-coloured silk cap, and
      his whole person enveloped in a blue pilot coat with large mother-of-pearl
      buttons. The ominous green-pointed jockey whip was held between his knees,
      as with folded arms he lolled carelessly in the carriage, trying to look
      comfortable and unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Flintoff&rsquo;, how are ye?&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, waving his hand from
      his loftier vehicle, as they drew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Heslop, how goes it? Has anybody seen anything of Monsieur?&rdquo;
       asked he, without waiting for an answer to either of these important
      inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming, Sir Moses,&rdquo; cried several voices, and presently the
      Marseillaise hymn of liberty was borne along on the southerly breeze, and
      Jack&rsquo;s faded black hunting-cap was seen bobbing up and down in the crowd
      that encircled him, as he rode along on Paul Straddler&rsquo;s shooting pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack had been at the brandy bottle, and had imbibed just enough to make
      him excessively noisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three cheers for Monsieur Jean Rougier, de next Emperor of de French!&rdquo;
       cried he, rising in his stirrups, as he approached the crowd, taking off
      his old brown hunting-cap, and waving it triumphantly, &ldquo;Three cheers for
      de best foxer, de best fencer, de best fighter in all Europe!&rdquo; and at a
      second flourish of the cap the crowd came into the humour of the thing,
      and cheered him lustily. And then of course it was one cheer more for
      Monsieur; and one cheer more he got.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three cheers for ould England!&rdquo; then demanded Mr. Gallon on behalf of Mr.
      Flintoff, which being duly responded to, he again asked &ldquo;What onybody
      would do &lsquo;boot it Frenchman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, standing erect in his dogcart, and
      waving his hand for silence: &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, listen to me!&rdquo; Instead of
      which somebody roared out, &ldquo;Three cheers for Sir Moses!&rdquo; and at it they
      went again, <i>Hooray, hooray, hooray</i>, for when an English mob once
      begins cheering, it never knows when to stop. &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, listen to
      me,&rdquo; again cried he, as soon as the noise had subsided. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one o&rsquo;clock,
      and it&rsquo;s time to proceed to business. I called you here that there might
      be no unnecessary trespass or tampering with the ground, and I think I&rsquo;ve
      chosen a line that will enable you all to see without risk to yourselves
      or injury to anyone&rdquo; (applause, mingled with a tinkling of the little
      bells). &ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;follow me, and I&rsquo;ll show you the way;&rdquo; so
      saying, he resumed his seat, and passing through the gate turned short to
      the right, taking the diagonal road leading down the hill, in the
      direction of Featherbedfordshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can it be?&rdquo; was then the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied one of the know-everything ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rainford, for a guinea!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Gallon, fighting with Tippy Tom,
      who wanted to be back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say Rushworth!&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Heslop, cutting in before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the sort!&rdquo; asserted Mr. Buckwheat; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s for Harlingson green
      to a certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heterogeneous cavalcade then fell into line, the vehicles and
      pedestrians keeping the road, while the horsemen spread out on either side
      of the open common, with the spirit of speculation divided between where
      the race was to be and who was to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they descended the hill and joined the broad, once well-kept
      turnpike, whose neglected milestones still denoted the distance between
      London and Hinton&mdash;London so many miles on one side, Hinton so many
      miles on the other&mdash;things fast passing into the regions of
      antiquity. Sir Moses now put on a little quicker, and passing through the
      village of Nettleton and clearing the plantation beyond, a long strip of
      country lay open to the eye, hemmed in between the parallel lines of the
      old road and the new Crumpletin Railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then pulled up on the rising ground, and placing his whip in the
      socket, stood up to wait the coming of the combatants, to point them out
      the line he had fixed for the race. The spring tide of population flowed
      in apace, and he was presently surrounded with horsemen, gigmen, footmen,
      and bellmen as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen!&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, addressing Mr. Flintoff and Monsieur,
      who were again ranged on either side of his dogcart: &ldquo;Now, gentlemen, you
      see the line before you. The stacks, on the right here,&rdquo; pointing to a row
      of wheat stacks in the adjoining field, &ldquo;are the starting post, and you
      have to make your ways as straight as ever you can to Lawristone Clump
      yonder,&rdquo; pointing to a clump of dark Scotch firs standing against the
      clear blue sky, on a little round hill, about the middle of a rich old
      pasture on Thrivewell Farm, the clump being now rendered more conspicuous
      by sundry vehicles clustered about its base, the fair inmates of which had
      received a private hint from Sir Moses where to go to. The Baronet always
      played up to the fair, with whom he flattered himself he was a great
      favourite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, you see,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t get wrong, for you&rsquo;ve
      nothing to do but to keep between the lines of the rail and the road, on
      to neither of which must you come: and now you gentlemen,&rdquo; continued he,
      addressing the spectators generally, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not the slightest occasion
      for any of you to go off the road, for you&rsquo;ll see a great deal better on
      it, and save both your own necks and the farmers&rsquo; crops; so just let me
      advise you to keep where you are, and follow the jockeys field by field as
      they go. And now, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued he, again addressing the
      competitors, &lsquo;&ldquo;having said all I have to say on the subject, I advise you
      to get your horses and make a start of it, for though the day is fine its
      still winter, you&rsquo;ll remember, and there are several ladies waiting for
      your coming.&rdquo; So saying, Sir Moses soused down in his seat, and prepared
      to watch the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flintoff was the first to peel; and his rich orange and white silk
      jacket, natty doeskins, and paper-like boots, showed that he had got
      himself up as well with a due regard to elegance as to lightness. He even
      emptied some halfpence out of his pockets, in order that he might not
      carry extra weight. He would, however, have been a great deal happier at
      home. There was no &ldquo;yoieks, wind him,&rdquo; or &ldquo;yoicks, push &lsquo;im up,&rdquo; in him
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur did not show to so much advantage as Cuddy; but still he was a
      good deal better attired than he was out hunting on the Crooked-Billet
      day. He still retained the old brown cap, but in lieu of the shabby
      scarlet, pegtop trousers and opera-boots, he sported a red silk jacket, a
      pair of old-fashioned broad-seamed leathers, and mahogany boots&mdash;the
      cap being the property of Sir Moses&rsquo;s huntsman, Tom Findlater, the other
      articles belonging to Mr. George Gallon of the Rose and Crown. And the
      sight of them, as Monsieur stripped, seemed to inspirit the lender, for he
      immediately broke out with the old inquiry, &ldquo;What does onybody say &lsquo;boot
      it Frenchman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> say &lsquo;boot it Frenchman, Sir Moses?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses was silent, for he couldn&rsquo;t see his way to a satisfactory
      investment; so, rising in his seat, he holloaed out to the grooms, who
      were waiting their orders outside the crowd, to &ldquo;bring in the horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make way, there! make way, there!&rdquo; cried he, as the hooded and sheeted
      animals approached and made up to their respective riders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Takeoff his nightcap! take off his nightcap!&rdquo; cried Jack, pulling
      pettedly at the strings of the hood; &ldquo;take off his nightcap!&rdquo; repeated he,
      stamping furiously, amid the laughter of the bystanders, many of whom had
      never seen a Frenchman, let alone a mounted one, before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The obnoxious nightcap being removed, and the striped sheet swept over his
      tail, Mr. Rowley Abingdon&rsquo;s grey horse Mayfly Blood showing himself as if
      he was in a dealer&rsquo;s yard, for as yet he had not ascertained what he was
      out for. A horse knows when he is going to hunt, or going to exercise, or
      going to be shod, or going to the public house, but these unaccustomed
      jaunts puzzle him. Monsieur now proceeded to inform him by clutching at
      the reins, as he stood preparing for a leg-up on the wrong side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other side, mun, the other side,&rdquo; whispered Paul Straddler in his
      ear; whereupon Monsieur passed under the horse&rsquo;s head, and appeared as he
      ought. The movement, however, was not lost on Sir Moses, who forthwith
      determined to back Cuddy. Cuddy might be bad, but Monsieur must be worse,
      he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay an even five on Mr. Flintoff!&rdquo; cried he in a loud and audible
      voice. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay an even five on Mr. Flintoff,&rdquo; repeated he, looking
      boldly round. &ldquo;Gallon, what say you?&rdquo; asked he, appealing to the hero of
      the white horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done, Sir Moses, can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; replied Gallon, grinning from
      ear to ear, with a shake of his great bull head. &ldquo;Tak yeer three to two if
      you loike,&rdquo; added he, anxious to be on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses now shook his head in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back myself, two pound ten&mdash;forty shillin&rsquo;, to beat dis serene and
      elegant Englishman!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, now bumping up and down in his saddle
      as if to establish a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you owe him any wages?&rdquo; asked Sir Moses of Billy in an under-tone,
      wishing to ascertain what chance there was of being paid if he won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse, I owe him some,&rdquo; replied Billy; but how much he couldn&rsquo;t say, not
      having had Jack&rsquo;s book lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses caught at the answer, and the next time Jack offered to back
      himself, he was down upon him with a &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay you an even
      pund if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart, Sare Moses Baronet,&rdquo; replied Jack gaily; adding, &ldquo;you
      are de most engagin&rsquo;, agreeable mans I knows; a perfect beauty vidout de
      paint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gallon now saw his time was come, and he went at Sir Moses with a &ldquo;Weell,
      coom, ar&rsquo;le lay ye an even foive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried the Baronet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tenner, if you loike!&rdquo; continued Gallon, waxing valiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me von vet sponge, get me von vet sponge,&rdquo; now exclaimed Jack,
      looking about for the groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wet sponge! What the deuce do you want with a wet sponge?&rdquo; demanded Sir
      Moses with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet sponge, just damp my knees leetle&mdash;make me stick on better,&rdquo;
       replied Jack, turning first one knee and then the other out of the saddle
      to get sponged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dom it, if it&rsquo;s come to that, I may as well have the ten,&rdquo; muttered Sir
      Moses to himself. So, nodding to Gallon, he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said Gallon, with a nod, and the bet was made&mdash;Done, and
      Done, being enough between gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, stepping down from his dogcart, &ldquo;come into
      the field, and I&rsquo;ll start you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away then the combatants went, and the betting became brisk in the ring.
      Mr. Flintoff the favourite at evens.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ROM the Nettleton
      cornstacks to Lawristone Clump was under two miles, and, barring Bendibus
      Brook, there was nothing formidable in the line&mdash;nothing at least to
      a peaceably disposed man pursuing the even tenor of his way, either on
      horseback or in his carriage along the deserted London road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very different, however, did the landscape now appear to our friend Cuddy
      Flintoff as he saw it stretching away in diminishing perspective,
      presenting an alternating course of husbandry stubble after grass, wheat
      after stubble, seeds after wheat, with perhaps pasture again after fallow.
      Bendibus, too, as its name indicates, seemed to be here, there, and
      everywhere; here, as shown by the stone bridge on the road,&mdash;there,
      as marked by the pollard willows lower down&mdash;and generally wherever
      there was an inconvenient breadth and irregularity of fence. The more Mr.
      Flintoff looked at the landscape, the less he liked it. Still he had a
      noble horse under him in General Havelock&mdash;a horse that could go
      through deep as fast as he could over grass, and that only required
      holding together and sitting on to carry him safe over his fences. It was
      just that, however, that Cuddy couldn&rsquo;t master. He couldn&rsquo;t help fancying
      that the horse would let him down, and he didn&rsquo;t like the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayfly, on the other hand, was rather skittish, and began prancing and
      capering as soon as he got off the road into the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get &lsquo;im by de nob! get &lsquo;im by de nob!&rdquo; cried Jack, setting up his
      shoulders. &ldquo;Swing &lsquo;im round by de tail! swing &lsquo;im round by de tail!&rdquo;
       continued he, as the horse still turned away from his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ord dom it, that&rsquo;s that nasty crazy brute of old Rowley Abingdon&rsquo;s, I do
      declare!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, getting out of the now plunging horse&rsquo;s
      way. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know the beggar since he was clipped. That&rsquo;s the brute that
      killed poor Cherisher,&mdash;best hound in my pack. Take care, Monsieur!
      that horse will eat you if he gets you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat me!&rdquo; cried Jack, pretending alarm; &ldquo;dat vod be vare unkind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>. &ldquo;Unkind or not, he&rsquo;ll do it, I assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear! oh! dear!&rdquo; cried Jack, as the horse laid back his ears, and
      gave a sort of wincing kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, emboldened by Jack&rsquo;s fear, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      lay you a crown you don&rsquo;t get over the brook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crown, sare! I have no crowns,&rdquo; replied Jack, pulling the horse round.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lay ve sovereign&mdash;von pon ten, if vou like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll make it ten shillings. I&rsquo;ll make it ten shillings,&rdquo; replied
      Sir Moses: adding, &ldquo;Mr. Flintoff is my witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; cried Monsieur. &ldquo;Done! I takes the vager. Von pon I beats old
      Cuddy to de clomp, ten shillin&rsquo; I gets over de brook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; rejoined Sir Moses, &ldquo;all right! Now,&rdquo; continued he, clapping
      his hands, &ldquo;get your horses together&mdash;one, two, three, and <i>away!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up bounced Mayfly in the air; away went Cuddy amidst the cheers and shouts
      of the roadsters&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Flintoff! Flintoff! Flinfoff!! The yaller! the
      yaller! the yaller!</i>&rdquo; followed by a general rush along the grass-grown
      Macadamised road, between London and Hinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dat is your game, is it?&rdquo; asked Jack as Mayfly, after a series of
      minor evolutions, subsided on all fours in a sort of attitude of
      attention. &ldquo;Dat is your game, is it!&rdquo; saying which he just took him short
      by the head, and, pressing his knees closely into the saddle, gave him
      such a couple of persuasive digs with his spurs as sent him bounding away
      after the General. &ldquo;<i>Go it, Frenchman!</i>&rdquo; was now the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go it! aye he <i>can</i> go it,&rdquo; muttered Jack, as the horse now dropped
      on the bit, and laid himself out for work. He was soon in the wake of his
      opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first field was a well-drained wheat stubble, with a newly plashed
      fence on the ground between it and the adjoining pasture; which,
      presenting no obstacle, they both went at it as if bent on contending for
      the lead, Monsieur <i>sacré</i>ing, grinning, and grimacing, after the
      manner of his adopted country; while Mr. Flintoff sailed away in the true
      jockey style, thinking he was doing the thing uncommonly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small as the fence was, however, it afforded Jack an opportunity of
      shooting into his horse&rsquo;s shoulders, which Cuddy perceiving, he gave a
      piercing view holloa, and spurred away as if bent on bidding him goodbye.
      This set Jack on his mettle; and getting back into his seat he gathered
      his horse together and set too, elbows and legs, elbows and legs, in a way
      that looked very like frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>feint</i> of a fall, however, was a five-pound note in Mr. Gallon&rsquo;s
      way, for Jack did it so naturally that there was an immediate backing of
      Cuddv. &ldquo;<i>Flintoff! Flintoff! Flintoff! The yaller! the yaller! the
      yaller!</i>&rdquo; was again the cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pasture was sound, and they sped up it best pace, Mr. Flintoff well in
      advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fence out was nothing either&mdash;a young quick fence set on the
      ground, which Cuddy flew in Leicestershire style, throwing up his right
      arm as he went. Monsieur was soon after him with a high bucking jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now upon plough,&mdash;undrained plough, too, which the recent
      rains bad rendered sticky and holding. General Havelock could have crossed
      it at score, but the ragged boundary fence of Thrivewell farm now
      appearing in view, Mr. Flintoff held him well together, while he scanned
      its rugged irregularities for a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the nastiest fences in the world,&rdquo; muttered Cuddy to himself,
      &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be bound to say there&rsquo;s a great yawning ditch either on this
      side or that. Dash it! I wish I was over,&rdquo; continued he, looking up and
      down for an exit. There was very little choice. Where there weren&rsquo;t great
      mountain ash or alder growers laid into the fence, there were bristling
      hazel uprights, which presented little more attraction. Altogether it was
      not a desirable obstacle. Even from the road it looked like something. &ldquo;<i>Go
      it, Cuddy! Go it!</i>&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, now again in his dogcart, from the
      midst of the crowd, adding, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing of a place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; muttered Cuddy, still looking up and down, adding, &ldquo;I wish you
      had it instead of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ord dom it, go at it like a man!&rdquo; now roared the Baronet, fearing for his
      investments. &ldquo;Go at it for the honour of the hunt! for the honour of
      Hit-im and Hold-im shire!&rdquo; continued he, nearly stamping the bottom of his
      dog-cart out. The mare started forward at the sound, and catching Tippy
      Tom with the shafts in the side, nearly upset Geordey Gallon, who, like
      Sir Moses, was holloaing on the Frenchman. There was then a mutual
      interchange of compliments. Meanwhile Cuddy, having espied a weak
      bush-stopped gap in a bend of the hedge, now walks his horse quietly up to
      it, who takes it in a matter-of-course sort of way that as good as says,
      &ldquo;What <i>have</i> you been making such a bother about.&rdquo; He then gathers
      himself together, and shoots easily over the wide ditch on the far side,
      Cuddy hugging himself at its depth as he lands. Monsieur then exclaiming,
      &ldquo;Dem it, I vill not make two bites of von cherry,&rdquo; goes at the same place
      at the rate of twenty miles an hour, and beat beside Cuddy ere the latter
      had well recovered from his surprise at the feat. &ldquo;Ord rot it!&rdquo; exclaimed
      he, starting round, &ldquo;what d&rsquo;ye mean by following a man that way? If I&rsquo;d
      fallen, you&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been a-top of me to a certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never fear,&rdquo; replied Monsieur, grinning and flourishing his whip.
      &ldquo;Oh, never fear, I vod have &lsquo;elped you to pick up de pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pick up the pieces, sir!&rdquo; retorted Cuddy angrily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pick
      up the pieces. I want to ride the race as it should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come then, old cock,&rdquo; cried Monsieur, spurring past, &ldquo;you shall jomp &lsquo;pon
      me if you can.&rdquo; So saying, Jack hustled away over a somewhat swampy
      enclosure, and popping through an open bridle-gate, led the way into a
      large rich alluvial pasture beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack&rsquo;s feat at the boundary fence, coupled with the manner in which he now
      sat and handled his horse, caused a revulsion of feeling on the road, and
      Gallon&rsquo;s stentorian roar of &ldquo;The <i>Frenchman! the Frenchman!</i>&rdquo; now
      drowned the vociferations on behalf of Mr. Flintoff and the &ldquo;yaller.&rdquo; Sir
      Moses bit his lips and ground his teeth with undisguised dismay. If
      Flintoff let the beggar beat him, he&mdash;-he didn&rsquo;t know what he would
      do. &ldquo;<i>Flintoff! Flintoff!</i>&rdquo; shrieked he as Cuddy again took the lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now dread Rendibus appears in view! There was no mistaking its
      tortuous sinuosities, even if the crowd on the bridge had not kept
      vociferating, &ldquo;The bruk! the bruk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bruk be hanged!&rdquo; growled Cuddy, hardening his heart for the conflict.
      &ldquo;The bruk be hanged!&rdquo; repeated he, eyeing its varying curvature, adding,
      &ldquo;if ever I joke with any man under the rank of a duke again, may I be
      capitally D&rsquo;d. Ass that I was,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;to take a liberty with this
      confounded Frenchman, who cares no more for his neck than a frog. Dashed,
      if ever I joke with any man under the rank of a prince of the blood
      royal,&rdquo; added he, weaving his eyes up and down the brook for a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Go at it full tilt!</i>&rdquo; now roars Sir Moses from the bridge; &ldquo;go at
      it full tilt for the honour of Hit-im and Hold-im shire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honour of Hit-im and Hold-im shire be hanged!&rdquo; growled Cuddy; &ldquo;who&rsquo;ll pay
      for my neck if I break it, I wonder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut along, old cock of vax!&rdquo; now cries Monsieur, grinning up on the grey.
      &ldquo;Cut along, old cock of vax, or I&rsquo;ll be into your pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Shove him along!</i>&rdquo; roars stentorian-lunged Gallon, standing erect
      in his stirrups, and waving Monsieur on with his hat. &ldquo;<i>Shove him along!</i>&rdquo;
       repeats he, adding, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll take it in his stride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayfly defers to the now-checked General, who, accustomed to be ridden
      freely, lays back his vexed ears for a kick, as Monsieur hurries up. Cuddy
      still contemplates the scene, anxious to be over, but dreading to go.
      &ldquo;Nothing so nasty as a brook,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;never gets less, but may get
      larger.&rdquo; He then scans it attentively. There is a choice of ground, but it
      is choice of evils, of which it is difficult to choose the least when in a
      hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the centre are sedgy rushes, indicative of a bad taking off, while
      the weak place next the ash involves the chance of a crack of the crown
      against the hanging branch, and the cattle gap higher up may be mended
      with wire rope, or stopped with some awkward invisible stuff. Altogether
      it is a trying position, especially with the eyes of England upon him from
      the bridge and road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go at it, mun!&rdquo; roars Sir Moses, agonised at his hesitation; &ldquo;Oh, go
      at it, mun! It&rsquo;s <i>nothin</i>&rsquo; of a place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; muttered Cuddy; &ldquo;wish you were at it instead of me.&rdquo; So
      saying, he gathers his horse together in an undecided sort of way, and
      Monsieur charging at the moment, lands Cuddie on his back in the field and
      himself in the brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0051" id="linkimage-0051"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">

    <h4>
      <a href="images/339.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Then a mutual roar arose, as either party saw its champion in distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Stick to him, Cuddy! stick to him!</i>&rdquo; roars Sir Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Stick to him, Mouncheer! stick to him!</i>&rdquo; vociferates Mr. Gallon on
      the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      They do as they are bid; Mr. Flintoff remounting just as Monsieur
      scrambles out of the brook, aud Cuddy&rsquo;s blood now being roused, he runs
      the General gallantly at it, and lands, hind legs and all, on the opposite
      bank. Loud cheers followed the feat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now anybody&rsquo;s race, and the vehemence of speculation is intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The red!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The yaller! the yaller!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The red!&rdquo; Mr. Gallon is
      frantic, and Tippy Tom leads the way along the turnpike as if he, too, was
      in the race. Sir Moses&rsquo;s mare breaks into a canter, and makes the action
      of the gig resemble that of a boat going to sea. The crowd rush pell-mell
      without looking where they are going; it is a wonder that nobody is
      killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lawristone Clump is now close at hand, enlivened with the gay parasols and
      colours of the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are but three more fences between the competitors and it, and seeing
      what he thinks a weak place in the next, Mr. Flintoff races for it over
      the sound furrows of the deeply-drained pasture. As he gets near it begins
      to look larger, and Cuddy&rsquo;s irresolute handling makes the horse swerve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, old stoopid!&rdquo; cries Jack, in a good London cabman&rsquo;s accent;
      &ldquo;Now, then, old stoopid! vot are ye stargazing that way for? Vy don&rsquo;t ye
      go over or get out o&rsquo; de vay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Go yourself</i>,&rsquo;&rdquo; growled Cuddy, pulling his horse round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go myself!&rdquo; repeated Jack; &ldquo;&lsquo;ow the doose can I go vid your great carcase
      stuck i&rsquo; the vay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My great carcase stuck i&rsquo; the way!&rdquo; retorted Cuddy, spurring and hauling
      at his horse. &ldquo;My great carcase stuck in the way! Look at your own, and be
      hanged to ye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, look at it!&rdquo; replied Jack, backing his horse for a run, and
      measuring his distance, he clapped spurs freely in his sides, and going at
      it full tilt, flew over the fence, exclaiming as he lit, &ldquo;Dere, it is for
      you to &rsquo;zamine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That feller can ride a deuced deal better than he pretends,&rdquo; muttered
      Cuddy, wishing his tailorism mightn&rsquo;t be all a trick; saying which he
      followed Jack&rsquo;s example, and taking a run he presently landed in the next
      field, amidst the cheers of the roadsters. This was a fallow, deep, wet,
      and undrained, and his well ribbed-up horse was more than a match for
      Jack&rsquo;s across it. Feeling he could go, Cuddy set himself home in his
      saddle, and flourishing his whip, cantered past, exclaiming, &ldquo;Come along
      old stick in the mud!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick i&rsquo; the mod ye!&rdquo; replied Jack, hugging and holding his sobbing
      horse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick i&rsquo; the mod ye! Stop till I gets off dis birdliming
      field, and I&rsquo;ll give you de go-bye, Cuddy, old cock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack was as good as his word, for the ground getting sounder on the slope,
      he spurted up a wet furrow, racing with Cuddy for the now obvious gap,
      that afforded some wretched half-starved calves a choice between the
      rushes of one field and the whicken grass of the other. Pop, Jack went
      over it, looking back and exclaiming to Cuddy, &ldquo;Bon jour! top of de
      mornin&rsquo; to you, sare!&rdquo; as he hugged his horse and scuttled up a
      high-backed ridge of the sour blue and yellow-looking pasture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The money was now in great jeopardy, and the people on the road shouted
      and gesticulated the names of their respective favourites with redoubled
      energy, as if their eagerness could add impetus to the animals. &ldquo;<i>Flintoff!
      Flintoff! Flintoff!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>The Frenchman! the Frenchman!</i>&rdquo; as
      Monsieur at length dropped his hands and settled into something like a
      seat. On, on, they went, Monsieur every now and then looking back to see
      that he had a proper space between himself and his pursuer, and, giving
      his horse a good dig with his spurs, he lifted him over a stiff
      stake-and-rice fence that separated him from the field with the Clump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; is now the cry on the hill, and fair faces at length
      turn to contemplate the galloppers, who come sprawling up the valley in
      the unsightly way fore-shortened horses appear to do. The road gate on the
      right flies suddenly open, and Tippy Tom is seen running away with Geordey
      Gallon, who just manages to manouvre him round the Clump to the front as
      Monsieur comes swinging in an easy winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorious victory for Geordey! Glorious victory for Monsieur! They can&rsquo;t
      have won less than thirty pounds between them, supposing they get paid,
      and that Geordey gives Jack his &ldquo;reglars.&rdquo; Well may Geordey throw up his
      shallow hat and hug the winner. But who shall depict the agony of Sir
      Moses at this dreadful blow to his finances? The way he dom&rsquo;d Cuddy, the
      way he dom&rsquo;d Jack, the way he swung frantically about Lawristone Clump,
      declaring he was ruined for ever and ever! After thinking of everybody at
      all equal to the task, we are obliged to get, our old friend Echo to
      answer &ldquo;Who!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XLV.<br/>HENEREY BROWN &amp; CO. AGAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE first paroxysm
      of rage being over, Sir Moses remounted his dog-cart, and drove rapidly
      off, seeming to take pleasure in making his boy-groom (who was at the
      mare&rsquo;s head) run after it as long as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it Baronet off?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Gallon, staring with astonishment
      at the fast-receding vehicle; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it, Baronet off?&rdquo; repeated he,
      thinking he would have to go to Pangburn Park for his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear Thir Mothes is gone!&rdquo; lisped pretty Miss Mechlinton, who wanted to
      have a look at our hero, Mr. Pringle, who she heard was frightfully
      handsome, and alarmingly rich. And the ladies, who had been too much
      occupied with the sudden rush of excited people to notice Sir Moses&rsquo;s
      movements, wondered what had happened that he didn&rsquo;t come to give his
      tongue an airing among them as usual. One said he had got the tooth-ache;
      another, the ear-ache; a third, that he had got something in his eye;
      while a satirical gentleman said it looked more like a B. in his bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ony hoo,&rdquo; however, as Mr. Gallon would say, Sir Moses was presently out
      of the field and on to the hard turnpike again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need scarcely say that Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s ride home with him was not of a
      very agreeable character: indeed, the Baronet had seldom been seen to be
      so put out of his way, and the mare came in for frequent salutations with
      the whip&mdash;latitudinally, longitudinally, and horizontally, over the
      head and ears, accompanied by cutting commentaries on Flintoff&rsquo;s utter
      uselessness and inability to do anything but drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      He &ldquo;never saw such a man&mdash;domd if ever he did,&rdquo; and he whipped the
      mare again in confirmation of the opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did matters mend on arriving at home; for here Mr. Mordecai Nathan met
      him in the entrance hall, with a very doleful face, to announce that
      Henerey Brown &amp; Co., who had long been coddling up their horses, had
      that morning succeeded in sloping with them and their stock to Halterley
      Fair, and selling them in open market, leaving a note hanging to the key
      in the house-door, saying that they had gone to Horseterhaylia where Sir
      Moses needn&rsquo;t trouble to follow them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ond dom it!&rdquo; shrieked the Baronet, jumping up in the air like a stricken
      deer; &ldquo;ond dom it! I&rsquo;m robbed! I&rsquo;m robbed! I&rsquo;m ruined! I&rsquo;m ruined!&rdquo; and
      tottering to an arm-chair, he sank, overpowered with the blow. Henerey
      Brown &amp; Co. had indeed been too many for him. After a long course of
      retrograding husbandry, they seemed all at once to have turned over a new
      leaf, if not in the tillage way, at all events in that still better way
      for the land, the cattle line,&mdash;store stock, with some symptoms of
      beef on their bones, and sheep with whole fleeces, going on all-fours
      depastured the fields, making Mordecai Nathan think it was all the fruits
      of his superior management. Alaek a-day! They belonged to a friend of
      Lawyer Hindmarch&rsquo;s, who thought Henerey Brown &amp; Co. might as well eat
      all off the land ere they left. And so they ate it as bare as a board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ond dom it, how came you to let them escape?&rdquo; now demanded the Baronet,
      wringing his hands in despair; &ldquo;ond dom it, how came you to let them
      escape?&rdquo; continued he, throwing himself back in the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why really, Sir Moses, I was perfectly deceived; I thought they were
      beginning to do better, for though they were back with their ploughing,
      they seemed to be turning their attention to stock, and I was in hopes
      that in time they would pull round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull round!&rdquo; ejaculated the Baronet; &ldquo;pull round! They&rsquo;ll flatten me I
      know with their pulling;&rdquo; and thereupon he kicked out both legs before him
      as if he was done with them altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      His seat being in the line of the door, a rude draught now caught his
      shoulder, which making him think it was no use sitting there to take cold
      and the rheumatism, he suddenly bounced up, and telling Nathan to stay
      where he was, he ran up stairs, and quickly changed his fine satiney,
      velvetey, holiday garments, for a suit of dingy old tweeds, that looked
      desperately in want of the washing-tub. Then surmounting the whole with a
      drab wide-awake, he clutched a knotty dog-whip, and set off on foot with
      his agent to the scene of disaster, rehearsing the licking he would give
      Henerey with the whip if he caught him, as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away he strode, as if he was walking a match, down Dolly&rsquo;s Close, over the
      stile, into Farmer Hayford&rsquo;s fields, and away by the back of the lodges,
      through Orwell Plantation and Lowestoff End, into the Rushworth and
      Mayland Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doblington farm-house then stood on the rising ground before him. It was
      indeed a wretched, dilapidated, woe-begone-looking place; bad enough when
      enlivened with the presence of cattle and the other concomitants of a
      farm; but now, with only a poor white pigeon, that Henerey Brown &amp;
      Co., as if in bitter irony, had left behind them, it looked the very
      picture of misery and poverty-stricken desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was red-tiled and had been rough-cast, but the casting was fast coming
      off, leaving fine map-like tracings of green damp on the walls,&mdash;a
      sort of map of Italy on one side of the door, a map of Africa on the
      other, one of Horseterhaylia about the centre, with a perfect battery of
      old hats bristling in the broken panes of the windows. Nor was this all;
      for, by way of saving coals, Henerey &amp; Humphrey had consumed all the
      available wood about the place&mdash;stable-fittings, cow-house-fittings,
      pig-sty-fittings, even part of the staircase&mdash;and acting under the
      able advice of Lawyer Hindmarch, had carried away the pot and oven from
      the kitchen, and all the grates from the fire-places, under pretence of
      having bought them of the outgoing tenant when they entered,&mdash;a fact
      that the lawyer said &ldquo;would be difficult to disprove.&rdquo; If it had not been
      that Henerey Brown &amp; Co. had been sitting rent-free, and that the
      dilapidated state of the premises formed an excellent subject of attack
      for parrying payment when rent came to be demanded, it would be difficult
      to imagine people living in a house where they had to wheel their beds
      about to get to the least drop-exposed quarter, and where the ceilings
      bagged down from the rafters like old-fashioned window-hangings. People,
      however, can put up with a great deal when it saves their own pockets.
      Master and man having surveyed the exterior then entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, looking round on the scene of desolation, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve
      made a clean sweep at all events.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have that,&rdquo; assented Mr. Mordecai Nathan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder it didn&rsquo;t strike you, when you caught them selling their straw
      off at night, that they would be doing something of this sort,&rdquo; observed
      Sir Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought it rather strange,&rdquo; replied Mr. Nathan; &ldquo;only they assured
      me that for every load of straw they sold, they brought back double the
      value in guano, or I certainly should have been more on the alert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guano be hanged!&rdquo; rejoined the Baronet, trying to open the kitchen
      window, to let some fresh air into the foul apartment; &ldquo;guano be hanged!
      one ton of guano makes itself into twenty ton with the aid of Kentish
      gravel. No better trade than spurious manure-manufacturing; almost as good
      as cabbage-cigar making. Besides,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;the straw goes off to a
      certainty, whereas there&rsquo;s no certainty about the guano coming back
      instead of it. Oh, dom it, man,&rdquo; continued he, knocking some of the old
      hats out of the broken panes, after a fruitless effort to open the window,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have walked the bailiffs into the beggars if I could have foreseen
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I, Sir Moses,&rdquo; replied Mr. Nathan; &ldquo;only who could we get to
      come in their place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That observation of Mr. Mordecai Nathan comprises a great deal, and
      accounts for much apparent good landlordism, which lets a bad tenant go on
      from year to year with the occasional payment of a driblet of rent,
      instead of ejecting him; the real fact being that the landlord knows there
      is no one to get to come in his place&mdash;no better one at least&mdash;and
      that fact constitutes one of the principal difficulties of land-owning. If
      a landlord is not prepared to take an out-of-order farm into his own
      hands, he must either put up with an incompetent non-paying tenant, or run
      the risk of getting a worse one from the general body of outlying
      incompetence. A farm will always let for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a regular rolling stock of bad farmers in every country, who pass
      from district to district, exercising their ingenuity in extracting
      whatever little good their predecessors have left in the land. These men
      are the steady, determined enemies to grass. Their great delight is to get
      leave to plough out an old pasture-field under pretence of laying it down
      better. There won&rsquo;t be a grass field on a farm but what they will take
      some exception to, and ask leave to have &ldquo;out&rdquo; as they call it. Then if
      they get leave, they take care never to have a good take of seeds, and so
      plough on and plough on, promising to lay it down better after each fresh
      attempt, just as a thimble-rigger urges his dupe to go on and go on, and
      try his luck once more, until land and dupe are both fairly exhausted. The
      tenant then marches, and the thimble-rigger decamps, each in search of
      fresh fields and flats new.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering that all writers on agriculture agree that grass land pays
      double, if not treble, what arable land does, and that one is so much more
      beautiful to the eye than the other, to say nothing of pleasanter to ride
      over, we often wonder that landlords have not turned their attention more
      to the increase and encouragement of grass land on their estates than they
      have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure they have always had the difficulty to contend with we have
      named, viz., a constant hankering on the part of even some good tenants to
      plough it out. A poor grass-field, like Gay&rsquo;s hare, seems to have no
      friends. Each man proposes to improve it by ploughing it out, forgetful of
      the fact, that it may also be improved by manuring the surface. The
      quantity of arable land on a farm is what puts landlords so much in the
      power of bad farmers. If farms consisted of three parts grass and one part
      plough, instead of three parts plough and one part grass, no landlord need
      ever put up with an indifferent, incompetent tenant; for the grass would
      carry him through, and he could either let the farm off, field by field,
      to butchers and graziers, or pasture it himself, or hay it if he liked.
      Nothing pays better than hay. A very small capital would then suffice for
      the arable land; and there being, as we said before, a rolling stock of
      scratching land-starvers always on the look-out for out-of-order farms, so
      every landowner should have a rolling stock of horses and farm-implements
      ready to turn upon any one that is not getting justice done it. There is
      no fear of gentlemen being overloaded with land; for the old saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a good thing to follow the laird,&rdquo; will always insure plenty of applicants
      for any farm a landlord is leaving&mdash;supposing, of course, that he has
      been doing it justice himself, which we must say landlords always do; the
      first result we see of a gentleman farming being the increase of the size
      of his stock-yard, and this oftentimes in the face of a diminished acreage
      under the plough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then see what a saving there is in grass-farming compared to tillage
      husbandry: no ploughs, no harrows, no horses, no lazy leg-dragging clowns,
      who require constant watching; the cattle will feed whether master is at
      home or polishing St. James&rsquo;s Street in paper boots and a tight
      bearing-rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the independence of the grass-farmer is so great. When the wind
      howls and the rain beats, and the torrents roar, and John Flail lies
      quaking in bed, fearing for his corn, then old Tom Nebuchadnezzar turns
      quietly over on his side like the Irish jontleman who, when told the house
      was on fire, replied, &ldquo;Arrah, by Jasus, I&rsquo;m only a lodger!&rdquo; and says, &ldquo;Ord
      rot it, let it rain; it&rsquo;ll do me no harm! I&rsquo;m only a grass-grower!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But we are leaving Sir Moses in the midst of his desolation, with nothing
      but the chilly fog of a winter&rsquo;s evening and his own bright thoughts to
      console him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dom it, I&rsquo;m off,&rdquo; exclaimed he, fairly overcome with the impurity of
      the place; and hurrying out, he ran away towards home, leaving Mr.
      Mordecai Nathan to lock the empty house up, or not, just as he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to Pangburn Park let us now follow the Baronet, and see what our
      friend Billy is about.

      CHAPTER XLVI.<br/>THE PRINGLE CORRESPONDENCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. Pringle&rsquo;s
      return was greeted with an immense shoal of letters, one from Mamma, one
      with &ldquo;Yammerton Grange&rdquo; on the seal, two from his tailors&mdash;one with
      the following simple heading, &ldquo;To bill delivered,&rdquo; so much; the other
      containing a vast catalogue of what a jury of tailors would consider
      youthful &ldquo;necessaries,&rdquo; amounting in the whole to a pretty round sum,
      accompanied by an intimation, that in consequence of the tightness of the
      money-market, an early settlement would be agreeable&mdash;and a very
      important-looking package, that had required a couple of heads to convey,
      and which, being the most mysterious of the whole, after a due feeling and
      inspection, he at length opened. It was from his obsequious friend Mr.
      Smoothley, and contained a printed copy of the rules of the Hit-im and
      Hold-im shire Hunt, done up in a little red-backed yellow-lined book, with
      a note from the sender, drawing Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s attention to the tenth rule,
      which stipulated that the annual club subscription of fifteen guineas was
      to be paid into Greedy and Griper&rsquo;s bank, in Hinton, by Christmas-day in
      each year at latest, or ten per cent, interest would be charged on the
      amount after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fi-fi-fifteen guineas! te-te-ten per cent.!&rdquo; ejaculated Billy, gasping
      for breath; &ldquo;who&rsquo;d ever have thought of such a thing!&rdquo; and it was some
      seconds before he sufficiently recovered his composure to resume his
      reading. The rent of the cover he had taken, Mr. Smoothley proceeded to
      say, was eight guineas a-year. &ldquo;Eight guineas a-year!&rdquo; again ejaculated
      Billy; &ldquo;eight guineas a-year! why I thought it was a mere matter of form.
      Oh dear, I can&rsquo;t stand this!&rdquo; continued he, looking vacantly about him.
      &ldquo;Surely, risking one&rsquo;s neck is quite bad enough, without paying for doing
      so. Lord Ladythorne never asked me for any money, why should Sir Moses? Oh
      dear, oh dear! I wish i&rsquo;d never embarked in such a speculation. Nothing to
      be made by it, but a great deal to be lost. Bother the thing, I wish I was
      out of it,&rdquo; with which declaration he again ventured to look at Mr.
      Smoothley&rsquo;s letter. It went on to say, that the rent would not become
      payable until the next season, Mr. Treadcroft being liable for that year&rsquo;s
      rent. &ldquo;Ah well, come, that&rsquo;s some consolation, at all events,&rdquo; observed
      our friend, looking up again; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s some consolation, at all events,&rdquo;
       adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take deuced good care to give it up before another year
      comes round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smoothley then touched upon the more genial subject of the hunt-buttons.
      he had desired Garnet, the silversmith, to send a couple of sets off the
      last die, one for Billy&rsquo;s hunting, the other for his dress coat; and he
      concluded by wishing our friend a long life of health and happiness to
      wear them with the renowned Hit-im and Hold-im shire hunt; and assuring
      him that he was always his, with great sincerity, John Smoothley.
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Billy, throwing the letter down; &ldquo;more happiness if I don&rsquo;t
      wear them,&rdquo; continued he, conning over his many misfortunes, and the great
      difficulty he had in sitting at the jumps. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;the
      dress ones will do for the balls,&rdquo; with which not uncommon consolation he
      broke the red seal of the Yammerton Grange letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was from our friend the Major, all about a wonderful hunt his
      &ldquo;haryers&rdquo; had had, which he couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation of writing to
      tell Billy of. The description then sprawled over four sides of letter
      paper, going an arrant burst from end to end, there not being a single
      stop in the whole, whatever there might have been in the hunt; and the
      Major concluded by saying, that it was by far the finest run he had ever
      seen during his long mastership, extending over a period of
      five-and-thirty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing his eye over its contents, how they found at Conksbury Corner,
      and ran at a racing pace without a check to Foremark Hill, and down over
      the water-meadows at Dove-dale Green to Marbury Hall, turning short at
      Fullbrook Folly, and over the race-course at Ancaster Lawn, doubling at
      Dinton Dean, and back over the hill past Oakhanger Gorse to Tufton Holt,
      where they killed, the account being interwoven, parenthesis within
      parenthesis, with the brilliant hits and performances of Lovely, and
      Lilter, and Dainty, and Bustler, and others, with the names of the
      distinguished party who were out, our old friend Wotherspoon among the
      number, Billy came at last to a sly postscript, saying that &ldquo;his bed and
      stall were quite ready for him whenever he liked to return, and they would
      all be delighted to see him.&rdquo; The wording of the Postscript had taken a
      good deal of consideration, and had undergone two or three revisions at
      the hands of the ladies before they gave it to the Major to add&mdash;one
      wanting to make it rather stronger, another rather milder, the Major
      thinking they had better have a little notice before Mr. Pringle returned,
      while Mamma (who had now got all the linen up again) inclined, though she
      did not say so before the girls, to treat Billy as one of the family. Upon
      a division whether the word &ldquo;quite&rdquo; should stand part of the Postscript or
      not, the Major was left in a minority, and the pressing word passed. His
      bed and stall were &ldquo;quite ready,&rdquo; instead of only &ldquo;ready&rdquo; to receive him.
      Miss Yammerton observing, that &ldquo;quite&rdquo; looked as if they really wished to
      have him, while &ldquo;ready&rdquo; looked as if they did not care whether he came or
      not. And Billy, having pondered awhile on the Postscript, which he thought
      came very opportunely, proceeded to open his last letter, a man always
      taking those he doesn&rsquo;t know first.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter was Mamma&rsquo;s&mdash;poor Mamma&rsquo;s&mdash;written in the usual
      strain of anxious earnestness, hoping her beloved was enjoying himself,
      but hinting that she would like to have him back. Butterfingers was gone,
      she had got her a place in Somersetshire, so anxiety on that score was
      over. Mrs. Pringle&rsquo;s peculiar means of information, however, informed her
      that the Misses Yammerton were dangerous, and she had already expressed
      her opinion pretty freely with regard to Sir Moses. Indeed, she didn&rsquo;t
      know which house she would soonest hear of her son being at&mdash;Sir
      Moses&rsquo;s with his plausible pocket-guarding plundering, or Major
      Yammerton&rsquo;s, with the three pair of enterprising eyes, and Mamma&rsquo;s mature
      judgment directing the siege operations. Mrs. Pringle wished he was either
      back at Tantivy Castle, or in Curtain Crescent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she did not like to be too pressing, but observed, as Christmas was
      coming, when hunting would most likely be stopped by the weather, she
      hoped he would run up to town, where many of his friends, Jack Sheppard,
      Tom Brown, Harry Bean, and others, were asking for him, thinking he was
      lost. She also said, it would be a good time to go to Uncle Jerry&rsquo;s, and
      try to get a settlement with him, for though she had often called,
      sometimes by appointment, she had never been able to meet with him, as he
      was always away, either seeing after some chapel he was building, or
      attending a meeting for the conversion of the Sepoys, or some other
      fanatics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter concluded by saying, that she had looked about in vain for a
      groom likely to suit him; for, although plenty had presented themselves
      from gentlemen wishing for high wages with nothing to do, down to those
      who would garden and groom and look after cows, she had not seen anything
      at all to her mind. Mr. Luke Grueler, however, she added, who had called
      that morning, had told her of one that he could recommend, who was just
      leaving the Honourable Captain Swellington; and being on his way to town
      from Doubleimupshire, where the Captain had got to the end of his tether,
      he would very possibly call; and, if so, Billy would know him by his
      having Mr. Grueler&rsquo;s card to present. And with renewed expressions of
      affection, and urging him to take care of himself, as well among the leaps
      as the ladies, she signed herself his most doting and loving &ldquo;Mamma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Groom!&rdquo; (humph) &ldquo;Swellington!&rdquo; (humph) muttered Billy, folding up the
      letter, and returning it to its highly-musked envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what sort of a beggar he&rsquo;ll be?&rdquo; continued he, twirling his
      mustachios; &ldquo;Wonder how he&rsquo;ll get on with Rougier?&rdquo; and a thought struck
      him, that he had about as much as he could manage with Monsieur. However,
      many people have to keep what they don&rsquo;t want, and there is no reason why
      such an aspiring youth as our friend should be exempt from the penance of
      his station. Talking of grooms, we are not surprised at &ldquo;Mamma&rsquo;s&rdquo;
       difficulty in choosing one, for we know of few more difficult selections
      to make; and, considering the innumerable books we have on the choice and
      management of horses, we wonder no one has written on the choice and
      management of grooms. The truth is, they are as various as the horse-tribe
      itself; and, considering that the best horse may soon be made a
      second-rate one by bad grooming, when a second-rate one may be elevated to
      the first class by good management, and that a man&rsquo;s neck may be broken by
      riding a horse not fit to go, it is a matter of no small importance. Some
      men can dress themselves, some can dress their horses; but very few can
      dress both themselves and their horses. Some are only fit to strip a horse
      and starve him. It is not every baggy-corded fellow that rolls slangily
      along in top-boots, and hisses at everything he touches, that is a groom.
      In truth, there are very few grooms, very few men who really enter into
      the feelings and constitutions of horses, or look at them otherwise than
      as they would at chairs or mahogany tables. A horse that will be perfectly
      furious under the dressing of one man, will be as quiet as possible in the
      hands of another&mdash;-a rough subject thinking the more a horse prances
      and winces, the greater the reason to lay on. Some fellows have neither
      hands, nor eyes, nor sense, nor feeling, nor anything. We have seen one
      ride a horse to cover without ever feeling that he was lame, while a
      master&rsquo;s eye detected it the moment he came in sight. Indeed, if horses
      could express their opinions, we fear many of them would have very
      indifferent ones of their attendants. The greater the reason, therefore,
      for masters giving honest characters of their servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend Mr. Pringle, having read his letters, was swinging up and down
      the little library, digesting them, when the great Mr. Bankhead bowed in
      with a card on a silver salver, and announced, in his usual bland way,
      that the bearer wished to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, wondering who it could be; &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; repeated he,
      taking the highly-glazed thin pasteboard missive off the tray, and
      reading, &ldquo;Mr. Luke Grueler, Half-Moon Street, Piccadilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grueler, Grueler!&rdquo; repeated Billy, frowning and biting his pretty lips;
      &ldquo;Grueler&mdash;I&rsquo;ve surely heard that name before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bearer, sir, comes <i>from</i> Mr. Grueler, sir,&rdquo; observed Mr.
      Bankhead, in explanation: &ldquo;the party&rsquo;s own name, sir, is Gaiters; but he
      said by bringing in this card, you would probably know who he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! to be sure, so I do,&rdquo; replied Billy, thus suddenly enlightened, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      just been reading about him. Send him in, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; whispered the bowing Bankhead as he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy then braced himself up for the coming interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      A true groom&rsquo;s knock, a loud and a little one, presently sounded on the
      white-over-black painted door-panel, and at our friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; the
      door opened, when in sidled a sleek-headed well put on groomish-looking
      man, of apparently forty or five-and-forty years of age. The man bowed
      respectfully, which Billy returned, glancing at his legs to see whether
      they were knock-kneed or bowed, his Mamma having cautioned him against the
      former. They were neither; on the contrary, straight good legs, well set
      off with tightish, drab-coloured kerseymere shorts, and continuations to
      match. His coat was an olive-coloured cutaway, his vest a canary-coloured
      striped toilanette, with a slightly turned-down collar, showing the
      whiteness of his well-tied cravat, secured with a gold flying-fox pin.
      Altogether he was a most respectable looking man, and did credit to the
      recommendation of Mr. Grueler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he was a groom of pretension&mdash;that is to say, a groom who
      wanted to be master. He was hardly, indeed, satisfied with that, and would
      turn a gentleman off who ventured to have an opinion of his own on any
      matter connected with his department. Mr. Gaiters considered that his
      character was the first consideration, his master&rsquo;s wishes and
      inclinations the second; so if master wanted to ride, say, Rob Roy, and
      Gaiters meant him to ride Moonshine, there would be a trial of skill which
      it should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gaiters always considered himself corporally in the field, and
      speculated on what people would be saying of &ldquo;his horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some men like to be bullied, some don&rsquo;t, but Gaiters had dropped on a good
      many who did. Still these are not the lasting order of men, and Gaiters
      had attended the dispersion of a good many studs at the Corner. Again,
      some masters had turned him off, while he had turned others off; and the
      reason of his now being disengaged was that the Sheriff of Doubleimupshire
      had saved him the trouble of taking Captain Swellington&rsquo;s horses to
      Tattersall&rsquo;s, by selling them off on the spot. Under these circumstances,
      Gaiters had written to his once former master&mdash;or rather employer&mdash;Mr.
      Grueler, to announce his retirement, which had led to the present
      introduction. Many people will recommend servants who they wouldn&rsquo;t take
      themselves. Few newly married couples but what have found themselves
      saddled with invaluable servants that others wanted to get rid of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutual salutations over, Gaiters now stood in the first position, hat in
      front, like a heavy father on the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend not seeming inclined to lead the gallop, Mr. Gaiters, after a
      prefatory hem, thus commenced: &ldquo;Mr. Grueler, sir, I presume, would tell
      you, sir, that I would call upon you, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just leaving the Honourable Captain Swellington, of the Royal
      Hyacinth Hussars, sir, whose regiment is ordered out to India; and fearing
      the climate might not agree with my constitution, I have been obliged to
      give him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; ejaculated Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have his testimonials,&rdquo; continued Gaiters, putting his hat between his
      legs, and diving into the inside pocket of his cutaway as he spoke. &ldquo;I
      have his testimonials,&rdquo; repeated he, producing a black, steel-clasped
      banker or bill-broker&rsquo;s looking pocket-book, and tedding up a lot of
      characters, bills, recipes, and other documents in the pocket. He then
      selected Captain Swellington&rsquo;s character from the medley, written on the
      best double-thick, cream-laid note-paper, sealed with the Captain&rsquo;s crest&mdash;a
      goose&mdash;saying that the bearer John Gaiters was an excellent groom,
      and might safely be trusted with the management of hunters. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      probably know who the Captain is, sir,&rdquo; continued Mr. Gaiters, eyeing
      Billy as he read it. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a son of the Right Honourable Lord Viscount
      Flareup&rsquo;s, of Flareup Castle, one of the oldest and best families in the
      kingdom&mdash;few better families anywhere,&rdquo; just as if the Peer&rsquo;s
      pedigree had anything to do with Gaiters&rsquo;s grooming. &ldquo;I have plenty more
      similar to it,&rdquo; continued Mr. Gaiters, who had now selected a few out of
      the number which he held before him, like a hand at cards. &ldquo;Plenty more
      similar to it,&rdquo; repeated he, looking them over. &ldquo;Here is Sir Rufus
      Rasper&rsquo;s, Sir Peter Puller&rsquo;s, Lord Thruster&rsquo;s, Mr. Cropper&rsquo;s, and others.
      Few men have horsed more sportsmen than I have done; and if my principals
      do not go in the first flight, it is not for want of condition in my
      horses. Mr. Grueler was the only one I ever had to give up for overmarking
      my horses; and he was so hard upon them I couldn&rsquo;t stand it; still he
      speaks of me, as you see, in the handsomest manner,&rdquo; handing our friend
      Mr. Grueler&rsquo;s certificate, couched in much the same terms as Captain
      Swellington&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; replied Billy, glancing over and then returning it, thinking, as
      he again eyed Mr. Gaiters, that a smart lad like Lord Ladythorne&rsquo;s Cupid
      without wings would be more in his way than such a full-sized magnificent
      man. Still his Mamma and Mr. Grueler had sent Gaiters, and he supposed
      they knew what was right. In truth, Gaiters was one of those overpowering
      people that make a master feel as if he was getting hired, instead of
      suiting himself with a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This preliminary investigation over, Gaiters returned the characters to
      his ample book, and clasping it together, dropped it into his capacious
      pocket, observing, as it fell, that he should be glad to endeavour to
      arrange matters with Mr. Pringle, if he was so inclined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend nodded, wishing he was well rid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not every place I would accept,&rdquo; continued Mr. Gaiters, growing
      grand; &ldquo;for the fact is, as Mr. Grueler will tell you, my character is as
      good as a Bank of England note; and unless I was sure I could do myself
      justice, I should not like to venture on an experiment, for it&rsquo;s no use a
      man undertaking anything that he&rsquo;s not allowed to carry out his own way;
      and nothing would be so painful to my feelings as to see a gentleman not
      turned out as he should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Pringle drawled a &ldquo;yarse,&rdquo; for he wanted to be turned out properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; continued Mr. Gaiters, changing his hat from his right hand
      to his left, subsiding into the second position, and speaking slowly and
      deliberately, &ldquo;I suppose you want a groom to take the entire charge and
      management of your stable&mdash;a stud groom, in short?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse, I s&rsquo;pose so,&rdquo; replied Billy, not knowing exactly what he wanted,
      and wishing his Mamma hadn&rsquo;t sent him such a swell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, sir,&rdquo; continued Mr. Gaiters, casting his eyes up to the dirty
      ceiling, and giving his chin a dry shave with his disengaged hand; &ldquo;Well,
      then, sir, I flatter myself I can fulfil that office with credit to myself
      and satisfaction to my employer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; assented Billy, thinking there would be very little satisfaction
      in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Buy the forage, hire the helpers, do everything appertaining to the
      department,&mdash;in fact, just as I did with the Honourable Captain
      Swellington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; said Billy, recollecting that his Mamma always told him never to
      let servants buy anything for him that he could help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I ask if you buy your own horses?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Gaiters, after a
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yarse, I do,&rdquo; replied Billy; &ldquo;at least I have so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! That would be a consideration,&rdquo; muttered Gaiters, compressing his
      mouth, as if he had now come to an obstacle; &ldquo;that would be a
      consideration. Not that there&rsquo;s any benefit or advantage to be derived
      from buying horses,&rdquo; continued he, resuming his former tone; &ldquo;but when a
      man&rsquo;s character&rsquo;s at stake, it&rsquo;s agreeable, desirable, in fact, that he
      should be intrusted with the means of supporting it. I should like to buy
      the horses,&rdquo; continued he, looking earnestly at Billy, as if to ascertain
      the amount of his gullibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Billy, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you do,&rdquo; thinking there wouldn&rsquo;t
      be many to buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Gaiters, relieved by the announcement; he always thought he
      had lost young Mr. Easyman&rsquo;s place by a similar demand, but still he
      couldn&rsquo;t help making it. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been doing justice to the Bank
      of England note character, indeed, if he hadn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; repeated he, emboldened by success, and thinking he had met with the
      right sort of man. He then proceeded to sum up his case in his mind,&mdash;forage,
      helpers, horses, horses, helpers, forage;&mdash;he thought that was all he
      required; yes, he thought it was all he required, and the Bank of England
      note character would be properly supported. He then came to the
      culminating point of the cash. Just as he was clearing his throat with a
      prefatory &ldquo;<i>Hre</i>&rdquo; for this grand consideration, a sudden rush and
      banging of doors foreboding mischief resounded through the house, and
      something occurred&mdash;&mdash;that we will tell in another chapter.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII.<br/>A CATASTROPHE.&mdash;A TÊTE-À-TÊTE DINNER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N, Sir, Sir,
      please step this way! please step this way!&rdquo; exclaimed the <i>delirium
      tremems</i> footman, rushing coatless into the room where our hero and Mr.
      Gaiters were,&mdash;his shirt-sleeves tucked up, and a knife in hand, as
      if he had been killing a pig, though in reality he was fresh from the
      knife-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sir, Sir, please step this way!&rdquo; repeated he, at once demolishing the
      delicate discussion at which our friend and Mr. Gaiters had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s ha-ha-happened?&rdquo; demanded Billy, turning deadly pale; for his
      cares were so few, that he couldn&rsquo;t direct his fears to any one point in
      particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, your &lsquo;oss has dropped down in a f-f-fit!&rdquo; replied the man,
      all in a tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fit!&rdquo; ejaculated Billy, brushing past Gaiters, and hurrying out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fit!&rdquo; repeated Gaiters, turning round with comfortable composure, looking
      at the man as much as to say, what do you know about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, f-f-fit!&rdquo; repeated the footman, brandishing his knife, and running
      after Billy as though he were going to slay him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dashing along the dark passages, breaking his shins over one of those
      unlucky coal-scuttles that are always in the way, Billy fell into an
      outward-bound stream of humanity,&mdash;Mrs. Margerum, Barbara the
      housemaid, Mary the Lanndrymaid, Jones the gardener&rsquo;s boy, and others, all
      hurrying to the scene of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already there was a ring formed round the door, of bare-armed helpers, and
      miscellaneous hangers-on, looking over each other&rsquo;s shoulders, who opened
      a way for Billy as he advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse was indeed down, but not in a fit; for he was dying, and expired
      just as Billy entered. There lay the glazy-eyed hundred-guinea Napoleon
      the Great, showing his teeth, reduced to the mere value of his skin; so
      great is the difference between a dead horse and a live one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad job!&rdquo; said Wetun, who was on his knees at its head, looking up; &ldquo;bad
      job!&rdquo; repeated he, trying to look dismal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! is he dead?&rdquo; demanded Billy, who could hardly realise the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead, ay&mdash;he&rsquo;ll never move more,&rdquo; replied Wetun, showing his
      fast-stiffening neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! why didn&rsquo;t you send for the doctor?&rdquo; demanded Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor! we had the doctor,&rdquo; replied Wetun, &ldquo;but he could do nothin&rsquo; for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; for him!&rdquo; retorted Billy; &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s rotten,&rdquo; replied Wetun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rotten! how can that be?&rdquo; asked our friend, adding, &ldquo;I only bought him
      the other day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you open &lsquo;im you&rsquo;ll find he&rsquo;s as black as ink in his inside, rejoined
      the groom, now getting up in the stall and rubbing his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but what&rsquo;s that with?&rdquo; demanded Billy. &ldquo;It surely must be owing to
      something. Horses don&rsquo;t die that way for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owing to a bad constitution&mdash;harn&rsquo;t got no stamina,&rdquo; replied Wetun,
      looking down upon the dead animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was posed with the answer, and stood mute for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That &lsquo;oss &lsquo;as never been rightly well sin he com&rsquo;d,&rdquo; now observed Joe
      Bates, the helper who looked after him, over the heads of the door-circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like his looks when he com&rsquo;d in from &lsquo;unting that day,&rdquo;
       continued Tom Wisp, another helper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nor the day arter nonther,&rdquo; assented Jack Strong, who was a capital
      hand at finding fault, and could slur over his work with anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Mr. Gaiters arrived; and a deferential entrance was opened for
      his broadcloth by the group before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Mr. Gaiters entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treating the dirty blear-eyed Wetun more as a helper than an equal, he
      advanced deliberately up the stall and proceeded to examine the dead
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked first up his nostrils, next at his eye, then at his neck to see
      if he had been bled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have cured that horse if I&rsquo;d had him in time,&rdquo; observed he to
      Billy with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither you nor no man under the sun could ha&rsquo; done it,&rdquo; asserted Mr.
      Wetun, indignant at the imputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could though&mdash;at least he never should have been in that state,&rdquo;
       replied Gaiters coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say you couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; retorted Wetun, putting his arms a-kimbo, and
      sideling up to the daring intruder, a man who hadn&rsquo;t even asked leave to
      come into his stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A storm being imminent, our friend slipped off, and Sir Moses arrived from
      Henerey Brown &amp;, Co.&lsquo;s just at the nick of time to prevent a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for a single night in a bad stable, a result that our readers will
      do well to remember when they ask their friends to visit them&mdash;&ldquo;Love
      me, love my horse,&rdquo; being an adage more attended to in former times than
      it is now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Pringle! I&rsquo;m so sorry to hear about your horse! go sorry to
      hear about your horse!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, rushing forward to greet our
      friend with a consolatory shake of the hand, as he came sauntering into
      the library, flat candlestick in hand, before dinner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the most
      unfortunate thing I ever knew in my life; and I wouldn&rsquo;t have had it
      happen at my house for all the money in the world&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if I would,&rdquo;
       added he, with a downward blow of his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy could only reply with one of his usual monotonous &ldquo;y-a-r-ses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said the Baronet, &ldquo;it shall not prevent your hunting to-morrow,
      for I&rsquo;ll mount you with all the pleasure in the world&mdash;all the
      pleasure in the world,&rdquo; repeated he, with a flourish of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank ye,&rdquo; replied Billy, alarmed at the prospect; &ldquo;but the fact is, the
      Major expects me back at Yammerton Grange, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothin!&rdquo; interrupted Sir Moses; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s nothin; hunt, and go there
      after&mdash;all in the day&rsquo;s work. Meet at the kennel, find a fox in five
      minutes, have your spin, and go to the Grange afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, indeed, yes, you shall,&rdquo; continued he, settling it so, &ldquo;shall have the
      best horse in my stable&mdash;Pegasus, or Atalanta, or Old Jack, or any of
      them&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if you shalln&rsquo;t&mdash;so that matter&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, but, but,&rdquo; hesitated our alarmed friend, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I shall
      have no way of getting there after hunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I&rsquo;ll manage that too,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, now in the generous mood.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage that too&mdash;shall have the dog-cart&mdash;the thing we
      were in to-day; my lad shall go with you and bring it back, and that&rsquo;ll
      convey you and your traps and all altogether. Only sorry I can&rsquo;t ask you
      to stay another week, but the fact is I&rsquo;ve got to go to my friend Lord
      Lundyfoote&rsquo;s for Monday&rsquo;s hunting at Harker Crag,&rdquo;&mdash;the fact being
      that Sir Moses had had enough of Billy&rsquo;s company and had invited himself
      there to get rid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noiseless Mr. Bankhead then opened the door with a bow, and they
      proceeded to a tête-à-tête dinner, Cuddy Flintoff having wisely sent for
      his things from Heslop&rsquo;s house, and taken his departure to town under
      pretence, as he told Sir Moses in a note, of seeing Tommy White&rsquo;s horses
      sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuddy was one of that numerous breed of whom every sportsman knows at
      least one&mdash;namely, a man who is always wanting a horse, a &ldquo;do you
      know of a horse that will suit me?&rdquo; sort of a man. Charley Flight, who
      always walks the streets like a lamplighter and doesn&rsquo;t like to be checked
      in his stride, whenever he sees Cuddy crawling along Piccadilly towards
      the Corner, puts on extra steam, exclaiming as he nears him, &ldquo;How are you,
      Cuddy, how are you? I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know of a horse that will suit you!&rdquo; So
      he gets past without a pull-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are keeping the soup waiting&mdash;also the fish&mdash;cod sounds
      rather&mdash;for Mrs. Margerum not calculating on more than the usual
      three days of country hospitality,&mdash;the rest day, the drest day, and
      the pressed day,&mdash;had run out of fresh fish. Indeed the whole repast
      bespoke the exhausted larder peculiar to the end of the week, and an adept
      in dishes might have detected some old friends with new faces. Some <i>rechauffers</i>
      however are quite as good if not better than the original dishes&mdash;hashed
      venison for instance&mdash;though in this case, when Sir Moses inquired
      for the remains of the Sunday&rsquo;s haunch, he was told that Monsieur had had
      it for his lunch&mdash;Jack being a safe bird to lay it upon, seeing that
      he had not returned from the race. If Jack had been in the way then, the
      cat would most likely have been the culprit, or old Libertine, who had the
      run of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the Baronet nor Billy however was in any great humour for eating,
      each having cares of magnitude to oppress his thoughts, and it was not
      until Sir Moses had imbibed the best part of a pint of champagne besides
      sherry at intervals, that he seemed at all like himself. So he picked and
      nibbled and dom&rsquo;d and dirted as many plates as he could. Dinner being at
      length over, he ordered a bottle of the green-sealed claret (his best),
      and drawing his chair to the fire proceeded to crack walnuts and pelt the
      shells at particular coals in the fire with a vehemence that showed the
      occupation of his mind. An observing eye could almost tell which were
      levelled at Henerey Brown, which at Cuddy Flintoff, and which again at the
      impudent owner of Tippy Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, having exhausted his spleen, he made a desperate dash at the
      claret-jug, and pouring himself out a bumper, pushed it across to our
      friend, with a &ldquo;help yourself,&rdquo; as he sent it. The ticket-of-leave butler,
      who understood wine, had not lost his skill during his long residence at
      Portsmouth, and brought this in with the bouquet in great perfection. The
      wine was just as it should be, neither too warm nor too cold; and as Sir
      Moses quaffed a second glass, his equanimity began to revive.
    </p>
    <p>
      When not thinking about money, his thoughts generally took a sporting
      turn,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Horses and hounds, and the system of kennel,
Leicestershire saga, and the hounds of old Moynell,
</pre>
    <p>
      as the song says; and the loss of Billy&rsquo;s horse now obtruded on his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the deuce it had happened he couldn&rsquo;t imagine; his man, Wetun,&mdash;and
      there was no better judge&mdash;said he seemed perfectly well, and a
      better stable couldn&rsquo;t be than the one he was in; indeed he was standing
      alongside of his own favourite mare, Whimpering Kate,&mdash;&lsquo;faith, he
      wished he had told them to take her out, in case it was anything
      infectious,&mdash;only it looked more like internal disease than anything
      else.&mdash;Wished he mightn&rsquo;t be rotten. The Major was an excellent man,&mdash;cute,&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and here he checked himself, recollecting that Billy was going back there
      on the morrow. &ldquo;A young man,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;should be careful who he
      dealt with, for many what were called highly honourable men were very
      unscrupulous about horses;&rdquo; and a sudden thought struck Sir Moses, which,
      with the aid of another bottle, he thought he might try to carry out. So
      apportioning the remains of the jug equitably between Billy and himself,
      he drew the bell, and desired the ticket-of-leave butler to bring in
      another bottle and a devilled biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wine won&rsquo;t hurt you,&rdquo; continued he, addressing our friend, &ldquo;that
      wine won&rsquo;t hurt you, it&rsquo;s not the nasty loaded stuff they manufacture for
      the English market, but pure, unadulterated juice of the grape, without a
      headache in a gallon of it so saying, Sir Moses quaffed off his glass and
      set it down with evident satisfaction, feeling almost a match for the
      owner of Tippy Tom. He then moved his chair a little on one side, and
      resumed his contemplation of the fire,&mdash;the blue lights rising among
      the red,&mdash;the gas escaping from the coal,&mdash;the clear flame
      flickering with the draught. He thought he saw his way,&mdash;yes, he
      thought he saw his way, and forthwith prevented any one pirating his
      ideas, by stirring the fire. Mr. Bankhead then entered with the bottle and
      the biscuit, and, placing them on the table, withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Pringle!&rdquo; cried Sir Moses cheerfully, seizing the massive cut-glass
      decanter, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s drink the healths of the young ladies at&mdash;&mdash;,
      you know where,&rdquo; looking knowingly at our friend, who blushed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
      a bumper to that,&rdquo; continued he, pouring himself out one, and passing the
      bottle to Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young ladies at Yammerton Grange!&rdquo; continued Sir Moses, holding the
      glass to the now sparkling fire before he transferred its bright
      ruby-coloured contents to his thick lips. He then quaffed it off with a
      smack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young ladies at Yammerton Grange!&rdquo; faltered Billy, after filling
      himself a bumper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice girls those, dom&rsquo;d if they&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; observed the Baronet, now
      breaking the devilled biscuit. &ldquo;You must take care what you&rsquo;re about
      there, though, for the old lady doesn&rsquo;t stand any nonsense; the Major
      neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy said he wasn&rsquo;t going to try any on&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but they&rsquo;ll try it on with you,&rdquo; retorted Sir Moses; &ldquo;mark my
      words if they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, but I&rsquo;m only there for hunting,&rdquo; observed Billy, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, with a jerk of his head, &ldquo;I dare say,&mdash;but
      it&rsquo;s very agreeable to talk to a pretty girl when you come in, and those
      <i>are</i> devilish pretty girls, let me tell you,&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if they&rsquo;re
      not,&mdash;only one talk leads to another talk, and ultimately Mamma talks
      about a small gold ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy was frightened, for he felt the truth of what Sir Moses said. They
      then sat for some minutes in silence, ruminating on their own affairs,&mdash;Billy
      thinking he would be careful of the girls, and wondering how he could
      escape Sir Moses&rsquo;s offer of a bump on the morrow,&mdash;Sir Moses thinking
      he would advance that performance a step. He now led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be wanting a horse to go with the Major&rsquo;s harriers,&rdquo; observed he;
      &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve got the very animal for that sort of work; that grey horse of
      mine, the Lord Mayor, in the five-stalled stable on the right; the safest,
      steadiest animal ever man got on to; and I&rsquo;ll make you a present of him,
      dom&rsquo;d if I won&rsquo;t; for I&rsquo;m more hurt at the loss of yours than words can
      express; wouldn&rsquo;t have had such a thing happen at my house on any account;
      so that&rsquo;s a bargain, and will make all square; for the grey&rsquo;s an
      undeniable good &lsquo;un&mdash;worth half-a-dozen of the Major&rsquo;s&mdash;and will
      do you some credit, for a young man on his preferment should always study
      appearances, and ride handsome horses; and the grey is one of the
      handsomest I ever saw. Lord Tootleton, up in Neck-and-crop-shire, who I
      got him of, gave three &lsquo;under&rsquo;d for him at the hammer, solely, I believe,
      on account of his looks, for he had never seen him out except in the ring,
      which is all my eye, for telling you whether a horse is a hunter or not;
      but, however, he <i>is</i> a hunter, and no mistake, and you are most
      heartily welcome to him, dom&rsquo;d if you&rsquo;re not; and I&rsquo;m deuced glad that it
      occurred to me to give him you, for I shall now sleep quite comfortable;
      so help yourself, and we&rsquo;ll drink Foxhunting,&rdquo; saying which, Sir Moses,
      who had had about enough wine, filled on a liberal heel-tap, and again
      passed the bottle to his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Billy, who had conned over the matter in his bedroom before dinner,
      had come to the conclusion that he had had about hunting enough, and that
      the loss of Napoleon the Great afforded a favourable opportunity for
      retiring from the chase; indeed, he had got rid of the overpowering Mr.
      Gaiters on that plan, and he was not disposed to be cajoled into a
      continuance of the penance by the gift of a horse; so as soon as he could
      get a word in sideways, he began hammering away at an excuse, thanking Sir
      Moses most energetically for his liberality, but expressing his inability
      to accept such a magnificent offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses, however, who did not believe in any one refusing a gift,
      adhered pertinaciously to his promise,&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, indeed, he should have
      him, he wouldn&rsquo;t be easy if he didn&rsquo;t take him,&rdquo; and ringing the bell he
      desired the footman to tell Wetun to see if Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s saddle would fit
      the Lord Mayor, and if it didn&rsquo;t, to let our friend have one of his in the
      morning, and &ldquo;here!&rdquo; added he, as the man was retiring, &ldquo;bring in tea.&rdquo;&mdash;And
      Sir Moses being peremptory in his presents, Billy was compelled to remain
      under pressure of the horse.&mdash;So after a copious libation of tea the
      couple hugged and separated for the night, Sir Moses exclaiming &ldquo;Breakfast
      at nine, mind!&rdquo; as Billy sauntered up stairs, while the Baronet ran off to
      his study to calculate what Henerey Brown &amp; Co. had done him out of.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII.<br/>ROUGIER&rsquo;S MYSTERIOUS LODGINGS&mdash;THE GIFT HORSE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. Gallon&rsquo;s
      liberality after the race with Mr. Flintoff was so great that Monsieur
      Rougier was quite overcome with his kindness and had to be put to bed at
      the last public-house they stopped at, viz.&mdash;the sign of the
      Nightingale on the Ashworth road. Independently of the brandy not being
      particularly good, Jack took so much of it that he slept the clock round,
      and it was past nine the next morning ere he awoke. It then took him good
      twenty minutes to make out where he was; he first of all thought he was at
      Boulogne, then in Paris, next at the Lord Warden Hotel at Dover, and
      lastly at the Coal-hole in the Strand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the recollection of the race began to dawn upon him&mdash;the
      red jacket&mdash;the grey horse, Cuddy in distress, and gradually he
      recalled the general outline of the performance, but he could not fill it
      up so as to make a connected whole, or to say where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then looked at his watch, and finding it was half-past four, he
      concluded it had stopped,&mdash;an opinion that was confirmed on holding
      it to his ear; so without more ado, he bounded out of bed in a way that
      nearly sent him through the gaping boards of the dry-rotting floor of the
      little attic in which they had laid him. He then made his way to the
      roof-raised window to see what was outside. A fine wet muddy road shone
      below him, along which a straw-cart was rolling; beyond the road was a
      pasture, then a turnip field; after which came a succession of green,
      brown, and drab fields, alternating and undulating away to the horizon,
      varied with here and there a belt or tuft of wood. Jack was no wiser than
      he was, but hearing sounds below, he made for the door, and opening the
      little flimsy barrier stood listening like a terrier with its ear at a
      rat-hole. These were female voices, and he thus addressed them&mdash;&ldquo;I
      say, who&rsquo;s there? Theodosia, my dear,&rdquo; continued he, speaking down stairs,
      &ldquo;vot&rsquo;s de time o&rsquo; day, my sweet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady thus addressed as Theodosia was Mrs. Windybank, a very forbidding
      tiger-faced looking woman, desperately pitted with the small-pox, who was
      not in the best of humours in consequence of the cat having got to the
      cream-bowl; so all the answer she made to Jack&rsquo;s polite enquiry was, &ldquo;Most
      ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most ten!&rdquo; repeated Jack, &ldquo;most ten! how the doose can that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hooiver,&rdquo; replied she, adding, &ldquo;you may look if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear, I&rsquo;ll take your word for it,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;but tell me,
      Susannah,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;whose house is this I&rsquo;m at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose house is&rsquo;t?&rdquo; replied the voice; &ldquo;whose house is&rsquo;t? why, Jonathan
      Windybank&rsquo;s&mdash;you knar that as well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De lady&rsquo;s not pleasant,&rdquo; muttered Jack to himself; so returning into the
      room, he began to array himself in his yesterday&rsquo;s garments, Mr. Gallon&rsquo;s
      boots and leathers, his own coat with Finlater&rsquo;s cap, in which he
      presently came creaking down stairs and confronted the beauty with whom he
      had had the flying colloquy. The interview not being at all to her
      advantage, and as she totally denied all knowledge of Pangburn Park, and
      &ldquo;de great Baronet vot kept the spotted dogs,&rdquo; Monsieur set off on foot to
      seek it; and after divers askings, mistakings, and deviations, he at
      length arrived on Rossington hill just as the servants&rsquo; hall dinner-bell
      was ringing, the walk being much to the detriment of Mr. Gallon&rsquo;s boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      In consequence of Monsieur&rsquo;s <i>laches</i>, as the lawyers would say, Mr.
      Pringle was thrown on the resources of the house the next morning; but Sir
      Moses being determined to carry out his intention with regard to the
      horse, sent the footman to remind Billy that he was going to hunt, and to
      get him his things if required. So our friend was obliged to adorn for the
      chase instead of retiring from further exertion in that line as he
      intended; and with the aid of the footman he made a very satisfactory
      toilette,&mdash;his smart scarlet, a buff vest, a green cravat, correct
      shirt-collar, with unimpeachable leathers and boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though this was the make-believe day of the week, Sir Moses was all hurry
      and bustle as usual, and greeted our hero as he came down stairs with the
      greatest enthusiasm, promising, of all things in the world! to show him a
      run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now bring breakfast! bring breakfast!&rdquo; continued he, as if they had got
      twenty miles to go to cover; and in came urn and eggs, and ham, and cakes,
      and tongue, and toast, and buns, all the concomitants of the meal.&mdash;At
      it Sir Moses went as if he had only ten minutes to eat it in, inviting his
      guest to fall-to also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they were in the midst of the meal a horse was heard to snort
      outside, and on looking up the great Lord Mayor was seen passing up the
      Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s your horse!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s your horse! been
      down to the shop to get his shoes looked to,&rdquo; though in reality Sir Moses
      had told the groom to do just what he was doing, viz.&mdash;to pass him
      before the house at breakfast-time without his clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord Mayor was indeed a sort of horse that a youngster might well be
      taken in with, grey, with a beautiful head and neck, and an elegantly
      set-on tail. He stepped out freely and gaily, and looked as lively as a
      lark.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, however, as great an impostor as Napoleon the Great; for,
      independently of being troubled with the Megrims, he was a shocking bad
      hack, and a very few fields shut him up as a hunter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, pausing in his meal, with the uplifted knife
      and fork of admiration, &ldquo;that, to my mind, is the handsomest horse in the
      country,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care where the next handsomest is.&mdash;Just look
      at his figure, just look at his action.&mdash;Did you ever see anything so
      elegant? To my mind he&rsquo;s as near perfection as possible, and what&rsquo;s more,
      he&rsquo;s as good as he looks, and all I&rsquo;ve got to say is, that you are most
      heartily welcome to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, thank&rsquo;e,&rdquo; replied Billy, &ldquo;thank&rsquo;e, but I couldn&rsquo;t think of accepting
      him,&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t think of accepting him indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, but you shall,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, resuming his eating, &ldquo;O but you shall,
      so there&rsquo;s an end of the matter.&mdash;And now have some more tea,&rdquo;
       whereupon he proceeded to charge Billy&rsquo;s cup in the awkward sort of way
      men generally do when they meddle with the tea-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses, having now devoured his own meal, ran off to his study, telling
      Billy he would call him when it was time to go, and our friend proceeded
      to dandle and saunter, and think what he would do with his gift horse. He
      was certainly a handsome one&mdash;handsomer than Napoleon, and grey was a
      smarter colour than bay&mdash;might not be quite so convenient for riding
      across country on, seeing the color was conspicuous, but for a hot day in
      the Park nothing could be more cool or delightful. And he thought it was
      extremely handsome of Sir Moses giving it to him, more, he felt, than
      nine-tenths of the people in the world would have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend&rsquo;s reverie was presently interrupted by Sir Moses darting back,
      pen and paper in hand, exclaiming, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye what, my dear Pringle!
      I&rsquo;ll tell ye what! there shall be no obligation, and you shall give me
      fifty puns for the grey and pay for him when you please. But <i>mark</i>
      me!&rdquo; added he, holding up his forefinger and looking most scrutinisingly
      at our friend, &ldquo;<i>Only on one condition, mind! only on one condition,
      mind!</i> that you give me the refusal of him if ever you want to part
      with him;&rdquo; and without waiting for an answer, he placed the paper before
      our friend, and handing him the pen, said, &ldquo;There, then, sign that I. O.
      U.&rdquo; And Billy having signed it, Sir Moses snatched it up and disappeared,
      leaving our friend to a renewal of his cogitations.
    </p>

    </h4>
    <p>
      Sir Moses having accomplished the grand &ldquo;do,&rdquo; next thought he would back
      out of the loan of the dog-cart. For this purpose he again came hurrying
      back, pen in hand, exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh dear, he was so sorry, but it had just
      occurred to him that he wanted the mare to go to Lord Lundyfoote&rsquo;s;
      however, I&rsquo;ll make it all square, I&rsquo;ll make it all square,&rdquo; continued he;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Jenkins, the postman, to send a fly as soon as he gets to
      Hinton, which, I make no doubt, will be here by the time we come in from
      hunting, and it will take you and your traps all snug and comfortable; for
      a dog-cart, after all, is but a chilly concern at this time of year, and I
      shouldn&rsquo;t like you to catch cold going from my house;&rdquo; and without waiting
      for an answer, he pulled-to the door and hurried back to his den. Billy
      shook his head, for he didn&rsquo;t like being put off that way, and muttered to
      himself, &ldquo;I wonder who&rsquo;ll pay for it though.&rdquo; However, on reflection, he
      thought perhaps he would be as comfortable in a fly as finding his way
      across country on horseback; and as he had now ascertained that Monsieur
      could ride, whether or not he could drive, he settled that he might just
      as well take the grey to Yammerton Grange as not. This then threw him back
      on his position with regard to the horse, which was not so favourable as
      it at first appeared; indeed, he questioned whether he had done wisely in
      signing the paper, his Mamma having always cautioned him to be careful how
      he put his name to anything. Still, he felt he couldn&rsquo;t have got off
      without offending Sir Moses; and after all, it was more like a loan than a
      sale, seeing that he had not paid for him, and Sir Moses would take him
      back if he liked. Altogether he thought he might be worse off, and,
      considering that Lord Tootleton had given three hundred for the horse, he
      certainly must be worth fifty. There is nothing so deceiving as price.
      Only tell a youngster that a horse has cost a large sum, and he
      immediately looks at him, while he would pass him by if he stood at a low
      figure. Having belonged to a lord, too, made him so much more acceptable
      to Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud crack of a whip, accompanied by a &ldquo;Now, Pringle!&rdquo; presently
      resounded through the house, and our friend again found himself called
      upon to engage in an act of horsemanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; cried he, starting from the little mirror above the scanty grey
      marble mantel-piece, in which he was contemplating his moustachios;
      &ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; and away he strode, with the desperate energy of a man bent on
      braving the worst. His cap, whip, gloves, and mits, were all laid ready
      for him on the entrance hall-table; and seizing them in a cluster, he
      proceeded to decorate himself as he followed Sir Moses along the intricate
      passages leading to the stable-yard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX.<br/>THE SHAM DAY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ATURDAY is a very
      different day in the country to what it is in London. In London it is the
      lazy day of the week, whereas it is the busy one in the country. It is
      marked in London by the coming of the clean-linen carts, and the hurrying
      about of Hansoms with gentlemen with umbrellas and small carpet-bags,
      going to the steamers and stations for pleasure; whereas in the country
      everybody is off to the parliament of his local capital on business. All
      the markets in Hit-im and Hold-im shire were held on a Saturday, and
      several in Featherbedfordshire; and as everybody who has nothing to do is
      always extremely busy, great gatherings were the result. This circumstance
      made Sir Moses hit upon Saturday for his fourth, or make-believe day with
      the hounds, inasmuch as few people would be likely to come, and if they
      did, he knew how to get rid of them. The consequence was, that the
      court-yard at Pangburn Park exhibited a very different appearance, on this
      occasion, to what it would have done had the hounds met there on any other
      day of the week. Two red coats only, and those very shabby ones, with very
      shady horses under them&mdash;viz., young Mr. Billikins of Red Hill Lodge,
      and his cousin Captain Luff of the navy (the latter out for the first time
      in his life), were all that greeted our sportsmen; the rest of the field
      being attired in shooting-jackets, tweeds, antigropolos and other
      anti-fox-hunting looking things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen! good morning!&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, waving his hand
      from the steps at the promiscuous throng; and without condescending to
      particularise any one, he hurried across for his horse, followed by our
      friend. Sir Moses was going to ride Old Jack, one of the horses he had
      spoken of for Billy, a venerable brown, of whose age no one&rsquo;s memory about
      the place supplied any information&mdash;though when he first came all the
      then wiseacres prophesied a speedy decline. Still Old Jack had gone on
      from season to season, never apparently getting older, and now looking as
      likely to go on as ever. The old fellow having come pottering out of the
      stable and couched to his load, the great Lord Mayor came darting forward
      as if anxious for the fray. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>your</i> saddle, sir,&rdquo; said Wetun,
      touching his forehead with his finger, as he held on by the stirrup for
      Billy to mount. Up then went our friend into the old seat of suffering.
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, as he got his feet settled in the stirrups;
      &ldquo;there, you do look well! If Miss &lsquo;um&rsquo; sees you,&rdquo; continued he, with a
      knowing wink, &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be all over with you;&rdquo; so saying, Sir Moses touched
      Old Jack gently with the spur, and proceeded to the slope of the park,
      where Findlater and the whips now had the hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Findlater, as we said before, was an excellent huntsman, but he had
      his peculiarities, and in addition to that of getting drunk, he sometimes
      required to be managed by the rule of contrary, and made to believe that
      Sir Moses wanted him to do the very reverse of what he really did. Having
      been refused leave to go to Cleaver the butcher&rsquo;s christening-supper at
      the sign of the Shoulder of Mutton, at Kimberley, Sir Moses anticipated
      that this would be one of his perverse days, and so he began taking
      measures accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Tom,&rdquo; said he, as huntsman and whips now sky-scraped to his
      advance&mdash;&ldquo;morning all of you,&rdquo; added he, waving a general salute to
      the hound-encircling group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Tom,&rdquo; said he, pulling up and fumbling at his horn, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      telling Mr. Pringle that we&rsquo;ll get him a gallop so as to enable him to
      arrive at Yammerton Grange before dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir Moses,&rdquo; replied Tom, with a rap of his cap-peak, thinking he
      would take very good care that he didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now whether will Briarey Banks or the Reddish Warren be the likeliest
      place for a find?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, Sir Moses, neither,&rdquo; replied Tom confidently, &ldquo;Tipthorne&rsquo;s the
      place for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was just what Sir Moses wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tipthorne, you think, do you?&rdquo; replied he, musingly. &ldquo;Tipthorne, you
      think&mdash;well, and where next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shillington, Sir Moses, and Halstead Hill, and so on to Hatchington
      Wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; replied the Baronet, &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;then let&rsquo;s be going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At a whistle and a waive of his hand the watchful hounds darted up, and
      Tom taking the lead, the mixed cavalcade swept after them over the now
      yellow-grassed park in a north-easterly direction, Captain Luff working
      his screw as if he were bent on treading on the hounds&rsquo; stems.
    </p>
    <p>
      There being no one out to whom Sir Moses felt there would be any
      profitable investment of attention, he devoted himself to our hero,
      complimenting him on his appearance, and on the gallant bearing of his
      steed, declaring that of all the neat horses he had ever set eyes on the
      Lord Mayor was out-and-out the neatest. So with compliments to Billy, and
      muttered &ldquo;cusses&rdquo; at Luff, they trotted down Oxclose Lane, through the
      little village of Homerton, past Dewfield Lawn, over Waybridge Common,
      shirking Upwood toll-bar, and down Cornforth Bank to Burford, when
      Tipthorne stood before them. It was a round Billesdon Coplow-like hill,
      covered with stunted oaks, and a nice warm lying gorse sloping away to the
      south; but Mr. Tadpole&rsquo;s keeper having the rabbits, he was seldom out of
      it, and it was of little use looking there for a fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being the case, of course it was more necessary to make a great
      pretension, so halting noiselessly behind the high red-berried hedge,
      dividing the pasture from the gorse, Tom despatched his whips to their
      points, and then touching his cap to Sir Moses, said, &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps Mr. Pringle
      would like to ride in and see him find.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, to be sure,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s both go in,&rdquo; whereupon Tom
      opened the bridle-gate, and away went the hounds with a dash that as good
      as said if we don&rsquo;t get a fox we&rsquo;ll get a rabbit at all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fox for a guinea!&rdquo; cried Findlater, cheering them, and looking at his
      watch as if he had him up already. &ldquo;A fox for a guinea!&rdquo; repeated he,
      thinking how nicely he was selling his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep your eye on this side,&rdquo; cried Sir Moses to Billy. &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll cross
      directly!&rdquo; Terrible announcement. How our friend did quake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Yap, yap, yap</i>,&rdquo; now went the shrill note of Tartar, the tarrier, &ldquo;<i>Yough,
      yough, yough</i>&rdquo; followed the deep tone of young Venturesome, close in
      pursuit of a bunny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Crack!</i>&rdquo; went a heavy whip, echoing through the air and resounding
      at the back of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      All again was still, and Tom advanced up the cover, standing erect in his
      stirrups, looking as if half-inclined to believe it was a fox after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Eloo in! Eloo in!</i>&rdquo; cried he, capping Talisman and Wonderful
      across. &ldquo;Yoicks wind &lsquo;im! yoicks push him up!&rdquo; continued he, thinking what
      a wonderful performance it would be if they did find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squeak, yap, yell, squeak,&rdquo; now went the well-known sound of a hound in a
      trap. It is Labourer, and a whip goes diving into the sea of gorse to the
      rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dom those traps,&rdquo; cries Sir Moses, as the clamour ceases, adding, &ldquo;no
      fox here, I told you so,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;should have gone to the Warren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then took out his box-wood horn and stopped the performance by a most
      discordant blast. The hounds came slinking out to the summons, some of
      them licking their lips as if they had not been there altogether for
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to, now, please Sir Moses?&rdquo; asked Tom, with a touch of his cap, as
      soon as he had got them all out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    </h4>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tally-ho!</i>&rdquo; cries Captain Luff, in a most stentorian strain&mdash;adding
      immediately, &ldquo;Oh no! I&rsquo;m mistaken, <i>It&rsquo;s a hare!</i>&rdquo; as half the hounds
      break away to his cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dom you and your noise,&rdquo; cries Sir Moses, in well-feigned disgust,
      adding&mdash;&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put your spectacles on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luff looks foolish, for he doesn&rsquo;t know what to say, and the excitement
      dies out in a laugh at the Captain&rsquo;s expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to, now, please, Sir Moses?&rdquo; again asks Tom, chuckling at his
      master&rsquo;s displeasure, and thinking how much better it would have been if
      he had let him go to the supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you please,&rdquo; growled the Baronet, scowling at Luff&rsquo;s nasty rusty
      Napoleons&mdash;&ldquo;where you please, you said Shillington, didn&rsquo;t you&mdash;anywhere,
      only let us find a fox,&rdquo; added he, as if he really wanted one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom then got his horse short by the head, and shouldering his whip,
      trotted off briskly, as if bent on retrieving the day. So he went through
      the little hamlet of Hawkesworth over Dippingham water meadows, bringing
      Blobbington mill-race into the line, much to Billy&rsquo;s discomfiture, and
      then along the Hinton and London turnpike to the sign of the Plough at the
      blacksmith&rsquo;s shop at Shillington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gorse was within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the &ldquo;Public,&rdquo; so Luff and some of
      the thirsty ones pulled up to wet their whistles and light the clay pipes
      of gentility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gorse was very open, and the hounds ran through it almost before the
      sots had settled what they would have, and there being a bye-road at the
      far end, leading by a slight <i>détour</i> to Halstead Hill, Sir Moses
      hurried them out, thinking to shake off some of them by a trot. They
      therefore slipped away with scarcely a crack of the whip, let alone the
      twang of a horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad work this,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, spurring and reining up alongside of
      Billy, &ldquo;bad work this; that huntsman of mine,&rdquo; added he, in an under tone,
      &ldquo;is the most obstinate fool under the sun, and let me give you a bit of
      advice,&rdquo; continued he, laying hold of our friend&rsquo;s arm, as if to enforce
      it. &ldquo;If ever you keep hounds, always give orders and never ask opinions.
      Now, Mister Findlater!&rdquo; hallooed he, to the bobbing cap in advance, &ldquo;Now,
      Mister Findlater! you&rsquo;re well called Findlater, by Jove, for I think
      you&rsquo;ll never find at all. Halstead Hill, I suppose, next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir Moses,&rdquo; replied Tom, with a half-touch of his cap, putting on a
      little faster, to get away, as he thought, from the spray of his master&rsquo;s
      wrath. And so with this comfortable game at cross purposes, master and
      servant passed over what is still called Lingfield common (though it now
      grows turnips instead of gorse), and leaving Cherry-trees Windmill to the
      left, sunk the hill at Drovers&rsquo; Heath, and crossing the bridge at the
      Wellingburn, the undulating form of Halstead Hill stood full before them.
      Tom then pulled up into a walk, and contemplated the rugged intricacies of
      its craggy bush-dotted face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a fox in the country one would think he&rsquo;d be here,&rdquo; observed
      he, in a general sort of way, well knowing that Mr. Testyfield&rsquo;s keeper
      took better care of them than that. &ldquo;Gently hurrying!&rdquo; hallooed he, now
      cracking his whip as the hounds pricked their ears, and seemed inclined to
      break away to an outburst of children from the village school below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom then took the hounds to the east end of the hill, where the lying
      began, and drew them along the face of it with the usual result, &ldquo;<i>Nil</i>.&rdquo;
       Not even a rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; said he, with well feigned chagrin, as Pillager,
      Petulant, and Ravager appeared on the bare ground to the west, leading out
      the rest of the pack on their lines. They were all presently clustering in
      view again. A slight twang of the horn brought them pouring down to the
      hill to our obstinate huntsman just as Captain Luff and Co. hove in sight
      on the Wellingburn Bridge, riding as boldly as refreshed gentlemen
      generally do.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for it then but Hatchington Wood, with its deep holding
      rides and interminable extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a Hatchington Wood in every hunt, wild inhospitable looking
      thickets, that seem as if they never knew an owner&rsquo;s care, where men light
      their cigars and gather in groups, well knowing that whatever sport the
      hounds may have, theirs is over for the day. Places in which a man may
      gallop his horse&rsquo;s tail off, and not hear or see half as much as those do
      who sit still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into it Tom now cheered his hounds, again thinking how much better it
      would have been if Sir Moses had let him go to the supper. &ldquo;<i>Cover
      hoick! Cover hoick!</i>&rdquo; cheered he to his hounds, as they came to the
      rickety old gate. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; got drunk,&rdquo; added he to himself. &ldquo;<i>Yoi,
      wind him! Yoi, rouse him, my boys!</i> what &lsquo;arm could it do him, my
      going, I wonders?&rdquo; continued he to himself. &ldquo;Yoi, try for him, Desp&rsquo;rate,
      good lass! Desp&rsquo;rate bad job my not gettin&rsquo;, I know,&rdquo; added he, rubbing
      his nose on the back of his hand; and so with cheers to his hounds and
      commentaries on Sir Moses&rsquo;s mean conduct, the huntsman proceeded from ride
      to road and from road to ride, varied with occasional dives into the fern
      and the rough, to exhort and encourage his hounds to rout out a fox; not
      that he cared much now whether he found one or not, for the cover had long
      existed on the reputation of a run that took place twelve years before,
      and it was not likely that a place so circumstanced would depart from its
      usual course on that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing certain, however, about a fox-hunt, but uncertainty; the
      worst-favoured days sometimes proving the best, and the best-favoured ones
      sometimes proving the worst. We dare say, if our sporting readers would
      ransack their memories, they will find that most of their best days have
      been on unpromising ones. So it was on the present occasion, only no one
      saw the run but Tom and the first whip. Coming suddenly upon a fine
      travelling fox, at the far corner of the cover, they slipped away with him
      down wind, and had a bona fide five and thirty minutes, with a kill, in
      Lord Ladythorne&rsquo;s country, within two fields of his famous gorse cover, at
      Cockmere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ord! rot ye, but ye should ha&rsquo; seen that, if you&rsquo;d let me go to the
      supper,&rdquo; cried Tom, as he threw himself off his lathered tail-quivering
      horse to pick up his fox, adding, &ldquo;I knows when to blow the horn and when
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Sir Moses, having got into a wrangle with Jacky Phillips about
      the price of a pig, sate on his accustomed place on the rising ground by
      the old tumble-down farm-buildings, wrangling, and haggling, and declaring
      it was a &ldquo;do.&rdquo; In the midst of his vehemence, Robin Snowball&rsquo;s camp of
      roystering, tinkering besom-makers came hattering past; and Robin, having
      a contract with Sir Moses for dog horses, gave his ass a forwarding bang,
      and ran up to inform his patron that &ldquo;the hunds had gone away through
      Piercefield plantins iver see lang since:&rdquo;&mdash;a fact that Robin was
      well aware of, having been stealing besom-shanks in them at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the devil!&rdquo; shrieked Sir Moses, as if he was shot. &ldquo;Oh, the devil!&rdquo;
       continued he, wringing his hands, thinking how Tom would be bucketing
      Crusader now that he was out of sight; and catching up his horse, he stuck
      spurs in his sides, and went clattering up the stony cross-road to the
      west, as hard as ever the old Jack could lay legs to the ground, thinking
      what a wigging he would give Tom if he caught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; continued he, pulling short up across the road, and nearly
      shooting Billy into his pocket with the jerk of his suddenly stopped
      horse, &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; repeated he, holding up his hand, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the horn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dom it! it&rsquo;s Parker, the postman,&rdquo; added he,&mdash;&ldquo;what business has
      the beggar to make such a row!&rdquo; for, like all noisy people, Sir Moses had
      no idea of anybody making a noise but himself. He then set his horse
      agoing again, and was presently standing in his stirrups, tearing up the
      wretched, starvation, weed-grown ground outside the cover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gained a sufficient elevation, he again pulled up, and turning
      short round, began surveying the country. All was quiet and tranquil. The
      cattle had their heads to the ground, the sheep were scattered freely over
      the fields, and the teams were going lazily over the clover-lays, leaving
      shiny furrows behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a sell, at all events!&rdquo; said he, dropping his reins. &ldquo;Be
      b&rsquo;und to say they are right into the heart of Featherbedfordshire by this
      time,&mdash;most likely at Upton Moss in Woodberry Yale,&mdash;as fine a
      country as ever man crossed,&mdash;and to think that that wretched deluded
      man has it all to himself!&mdash;I&rsquo;d draw and quarter him if I had him,
      dom&rsquo;d if I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; added Sir Moses, cutting frantically at the air with
      his thong-gathered whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend Billy, on the other hand, was all ease and composure. He had
      escaped the greatest punishment that could befall him, and was so clean
      and comfortable, that he resolved to surprise his fair friends at
      Yammerton Grange in his pink, instead of changing as he intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses, having strained his eye-balls about the country in vain, at
      length dropped down in his saddle, and addressing the few darkly-clad
      horsemen around him with, &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s all over for
      the day,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;Come, Pringle, let us be going,&rdquo; he poked his way past
      them, and was presently retracing his steps through the wood, picking up a
      lost hound or two as he went. And still he was so loth to give it up, that
      he took Forester Hill in his way, to try if he could see anything of them;
      but it was all calm and blank as before; and at length he reached Pangburn
      Park in a very discontented mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the court-yard stood the green fly that had to convey our friend back
      to fairy-land, away from the red coats, silk jackets and other the
      persecutions of pleasure, to the peaceful repose of the Major and his
      &ldquo;haryers.&rdquo; Sir Moses looked at it with satisfaction, for he had had as
      much of our friend&rsquo;s society as he required, and did not know that he
      could &ldquo;do&rdquo; him much more if he had him a month; so if he could now only
      get clear of Monsieur without paying him, that was all he required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, however, was on the alert, and appeared on the back-steps as Sir
      Moses dismounted; nor did his rapid dive into the stable avail him, for
      Jack headed him as he emerged at the other end, with a hoist of his hat,
      and a &ldquo;Bon jour, Sare Moses, Baronet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur, comment vous portez-vous?&rdquo; replied the Baronet, shying off,
      with a keep-your-distance sort of waive of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack, however, was not to be put off that way, and following briskly up,
      he refreshed Sir Moses&rsquo;s memory with, &ldquo;Pund, I beat Cuddy, old cock, to de
      clomp; ten franc&mdash;ten shillin&rsquo;&mdash;I get over de brook; thirty
      shillin&rsquo; in all, Sare Moses, Baronet,&rdquo; holding out his hand for the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ah, true,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, pretending to recollect the bets,
      adding, &ldquo;If you can give me change of a fifty-pun note, I can pay ye,&rdquo;
       producing a nice clean one from his pocket-book that he always kept ready
      for cases of emergency like the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty-pun note, Sare Moses!&rdquo; replied Jack, eyeing it. &ldquo;Fifty-pun note! I
      &lsquo;ave not got such an astonishin&rsquo; som about me at present,&rdquo; feeling his
      pockets as he spoke; &ldquo;bot I vill seek change, if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, thinking he had better not part with the
      decoy-duck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, though,&rdquo; continued he, restoring
      it to its case; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you a post-office order for the amount, or pay
      it to your friend, Mr. Gallon, whichever you prefer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, Sir Moses, Baronet,&rdquo; replied Jack, considering, &ldquo;I think de leetle
      post-office order vill be de most digestible vay of squarin&rsquo; matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Va-a-ry good,&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, &ldquo;Va-a-ry good. I&rsquo;ll send you one, then,&rdquo;
       and darting at a door in the wall, he slipped through it, and shot the
      bolt between Jack and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And our hero, having recruited nature with lunch, and arranged with Jack
      for riding his horse, presently took leave of his most hospitable host,
      and entered the fly that was to convey him back to Yammerton Grange. And
      having cast himself into its ill-stuffed hold he rumbled and jolted across
      country in the careless, independent sort of way that a man does who has
      only a temporary interest in the vehicle, easy whether he was upset or
      not. Let us now anticipate his arrival by transferring our imaginations to
      Yammerton Grange.

      CHAPTER L.<br/>THE SURPRISE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is all very well
      for people to affect the magnificent, to give general invitations, and say
      &ldquo;Come whenever it suits you; we shall always be happy to see you,&rdquo; and so
      on; but somehow it is seldom safe to take them at their word. How many
      houses has the reader to which he can ride or drive up with the certainty
      of not putting people &ldquo;out,&rdquo; as the saying is. If there is a running
      account of company going on, it is all very well; another man more or less
      is neither here nor there; but if it should happen to be one of those
      solemn lulls that intervene between one set of guests going and another
      coming, denoted by the wide-apart napkins seen by a side glance as he
      passes the dining-room window, then it is not a safe speculation. At all
      events, a little notice is better, save, perhaps, among fox-hunters, who
      care less for appearances than other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Saturday, as we said before, and our friend the Major had finished
      his week&rsquo;s work:&mdash;paid his labourers, handled the heifers that had
      left him so in the lurch, counted the sheep, given out the corn, ordered
      the carriage for church in case it kept dry, and as day closed had come
      into the house, and exchanged his thick shoes for old worsted worked
      slippers, and cast himself into a semicircular chair in the druggeted
      drawing-room to wile away one of those long winter evenings that seem so
      impossible in the enduring length of a summer day, with that best of all
      papers, the &ldquo;Hit-im and Hold-im shire Herald.&rdquo; The local paper is the
      paper for the country gentleman, just as the &ldquo;Times&rdquo; is the paper for the
      Londoner. The &ldquo;Times&rdquo; may span the globe, tell what is doing at Delhi and
      New York, France, Utah, Prussia, Spain, Ireland, and the Mauritius; but
      the paper that tells the squire of the flocks and herds, the hills and
      dales, the births and disasters of his native district, is the paper for
      his money. So it was with our friend the Major. He enjoyed tearing the
      half-printed halfwritten envelope off his &ldquo;Herald,&rdquo; and holding its damp
      sides to the cheerful fire until he got it as crisp as a Bank of England
      note, and then, sousing down in his easy chair to enjoy its contents,
      conscious that no one had anticipated them. How he revelled in the
      advertisements, and accompanied each announcement with a mental commentary
      of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      We like to see country gentlemen enjoying their local papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashover farm to let, conjured up recollections of young Mr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gosling spurting past in white cords, and his own confident prediction
      that the thing wouldn&rsquo;t last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burlinson the auctioneer&rsquo;s assignment for the benefit of his creditors,
      reminded him of his dogs, and his gun, and his manor, and his airified
      looks, and drew forth anathemas on Burlinson in particular, and on
      pretenders in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Napier&rsquo;s announcement that Mr. Draggleton of Rushworth had
      applied for a loan of four thousand pounds from the Lands Improvement
      Company for draining, sounded almost like a triumph of the Major&rsquo;s own
      principles, Draggleton having long derided the idea of water getting into
      a two-inch pipe at a depth of four feet, or of draining doing any good.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Major chuckled with delight at the thought of seeing the long
      pent-up water flow in pure continuous streams off the saturated soil, and
      of the clear, wholesome complexion the land would presently assume. Then
      the editorial leader on the state of the declining corn markets, and of
      field operations (cribbed of course from the London papers) drew forth an
      inward opinion that the best thing for the land-owners would be for corn
      to keep low and cattle to keep high for the next dozen years or more, and
      so get the farmers&rsquo; minds turned from the precarious culture of corn to
      the land-improving practice of grazing and cattle-feeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus the Major sat, deeply immersed in the contents of each page; but
      as he gradually mastered the cream of their contents, he began to turn to
      and fro more rapidly; and as the rustling increased, Mrs. Yammerton, who
      was dying for a sight of the paper, at length ventured to ask if there was
      anything about the Hunt ball in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hunt ball!&rdquo; growled the Major, who was then in the hay and straw market,
      wondering whether, out of the twenty-seven carts of hay reported to have
      been at Hinton Market on the previous Saturday, there were any of his
      tenants there on the sly; &ldquo;Hunt ball!&rdquo; repeated he, running the candle up
      and down the page; &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; about it here,&rdquo; replied he,
      resuming his reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be on the front page, my dear,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Yammerton, &ldquo;if there
      is anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give it you presently,&rdquo; replied the Major, resuming his
      reading; and so he wens on into the wool markets, thence to the potato and
      hide departments, until at length he found himself floundering among the
      Holloway Pills, Revalenta Food, and &ldquo;Sincere act of gratitude,&rdquo; &amp;c.,
      advertisements; when, turning the paper over with a wisk, and an inward
      &ldquo;What do they put such stuff as that in for?&rdquo; he handed it to his wife:
      while, John Bull like, he now stood up, airing himself comfortably before
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the paper fairly in Mamma&rsquo;s hands, than there was a general
      rush of the young ladies to the spot, and four pairs of eyes were eagerly
      glancing up and down the columns of the front page, all in search of the
      magical letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; for Ball. Education&mdash;Fall in Night Lights&mdash;Increased
      Rate of Interest&mdash;Money without Sureties&mdash;Iron and Brass
      Bedsteads&mdash;Glenfield Starch&mdash;Deafness Cured&mdash;German Yeast&mdash;Insolvent
      Debtor&mdash;Elkington&rsquo;s Spoons&mdash;Boots and Shoes,&mdash;but, alas! no
      Ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there it is! No it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; now cried Miss Laura, as her blue eye
      caught at the heading of Mrs. Bobbinette the milliner&rsquo;s advertisement, in
      the low corner of the page, Mrs. Bobbinette, like some of her customers,
      perhaps, not being a capital payer, and so getting a bad place. Thus it
      ran&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      HIT-IM AND HOLD-IM SHIRE HUNT BALL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &mdash;Mrs. Bobbinette begs to announce to the ladies her return from
      Paris, with every novelty in millinery, mantles, embroideries, wreaths,
      fans, gloves, &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Bobbinette be hanged,&rdquo; growled the Major, who winced under the very
      name of milliner; &ldquo;just as much goes to Paris as I do. Last time she was
      there I know she was never out of Hinton, for Paul Straddler watched her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but she gets very pretty things at all events,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
      Yammerton, thinking she would pay her a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, and a pretty bill she&rsquo;ll send in for them,&rdquo; replied the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, but you must pay for fashion, you know,&rdquo; rejoined Mamma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay for fashion! pay for haystacks!&rdquo; growled the Major; &ldquo;never saw such
      balloons as the women make of themselves. S&rsquo;pose we shall have them as
      flat as doors next. One extreme always leads to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This discussion was here suddenly interrupted by a hurried &ldquo;hush!&rdquo; from
      Miss Clara, followed by a &ldquo;hish!&rdquo; from Miss Flora; and silence being
      immediately accorded, all ears recognised a rumbling sound outside the
      house that might have been mistaken for wind, had it not suddenly ceased
      before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole party was paralysed: each drawing breath, reflecting on his or
      her peculiar position:&mdash;Mamma thinking of her drawing-room&mdash;Miss,
      of her hair&mdash;Flora, of her sleeves&mdash;Harriet, of her shabby shoes&mdash;the
      Major, of his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agony of suspense was speedily relieved by the grating of an iron step
      and a violent pull at the door-bell, producing ejaculations of, &ldquo;It <i>is</i>,
      however!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him, to a certainty!&rdquo; with, &ldquo;I told you so,&mdash;nothing but liver and
      bacon for dinner,&rdquo; from the Major; while Mrs. Yammerton, more composed,
      swept three pair of his grey worsted stockings into the well of the
      ottoman, and covered the old hearth-rug with a fine new one from the
      corner, with a noble antlered stag in the centre. The young ladies hurried
      out of the room, each to make a quick revise of her costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shock to the nervous sensibilities of the household was scarcely less
      severe than that experienced by the inmates of the parlour; and the driver
      of the fly was just going to give the bell a second pull, when our friend
      of the brown coat came, settling himself into his garment, wondering who
      could be coming at that most extraordinary hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major at home?&rdquo; asked our hero, swinging himself out of the vehicle into
      the passage, and without waiting for an answer, he began divesting himself
      of his muffin-cap, cashmere shawl, and other wraps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was then ready for presentation. Open went the door. &ldquo;Mr. Pringle!&rdquo;
       announced the still-astonished footman, and host and hostess advanced in
      the friendly emulation of cordiality. They were overjoyed to see him,&mdash;as
      pleased as if they had received a consignment of turtle and there was a
      haunch of venison roasting before the fire. The young ladies presently
      came dropping in one by one, each &ldquo;<i>so</i> astonished to find Mr.
      Pringle there!&rdquo; Clara thinking the ring was from Mr. Jinglington, the
      pianoforte-tuner; Flora, that it was Mr. Tightlace&rsquo;s curate; while Harriet
      did not venture upon a white lie at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salutations and expressions of surprise being at length over, the ladies
      presently turned the weather-conversation upon Pangburn Park, and inquired
      after the sport with Sir Moses, Billy being in the full glory of his pink
      and slightly soiled leathers and boots, from which they soon diverged to
      the Hunt ball, about which they could not have applied to any better
      authority than our friend. He knew all about it, and poured forth the
      volume of his information most freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the Major talked about there being nothing but liver and bacon for
      dinner, he knew very well that the very fact of there being liver and
      bacon bespoke that there was plenty of something else in the larder. In
      fact he had killed a south-down,&mdash;not one of your modern
      muttony-lambs, but an honest, home-fed, four-year-old, with its fine dark
      meat and rich gravy; in addition to which, there had been some minor
      murders of ugly Cochin-China fowls,&mdash;to say nothing of a hunted hare,
      hanging by the heels, and several snipes and partridges, suspended by the
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true, there was no fish, for, despite the railroad, Hit-im and
      Hold-im shire generally was still badly supplied with fish, but there was
      the useful substitute of cod-sounds, and some excellent mutton-broth;
      which latter is often better than half the soups one gets. Altogether
      there was no cause for despondency; but the Major, having been outvoted on
      the question of requiring notice of our friend&rsquo;s return, of course now
      felt bound to make the worst of the case&mdash;especially as the necessary
      arrangements would considerably retard his dinner, for which he was quite
      ready. He had, therefore, to smile at his guest, and snarl at his family,
      at one and the same time.&mdash;Delighted to see Mr. Pringle back.&mdash;Disgusted
      at his coming on a Saturday.&mdash;Hoped our hero was hungry.&mdash;Could
      answer for it, he was himself,&mdash;with a look at Madam, as much as to
      say, &ldquo;Come, you go and see about things and don&rsquo;t stand simpering there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Billy, who had eaten a pretty hearty lunch at Pangburn Park, had not
      got jolted back into an appetite by his transit through the country, and
      did not enter into the feelings of his half-famished host. A man who has
      had half his dinner in the shape of a lunch, is far more than a match for
      one who has fasted since breakfast, and our friend chatted first with one
      young lady, and then with another, with an occasional word at Mamma,
      delighted to get vent for his long pent-up flummery. He was indeed most
      agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Major was in and out of the room, growling and getting into
      everybody&rsquo;s way, retarding progress by his anxiety to hurry things on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length it was announced that Mr. Pringle&rsquo;s room was ready; and
      forthwith the Major lit him a candle, and hurried him upstairs, where his
      uncorded boxes stood ready for the opening keys of ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you are!&rdquo; cried the Major, flourishing the composite candle
      about them; &ldquo;there you are! needn&rsquo;t mind much dressing&mdash;only
      ourselves&mdash;only ourselves. There&rsquo;s the boot-jack,&mdash;here&rsquo;s some
      hot water,&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll have dinner as soon as ever you are ready.&rdquo; So
      saying, he placed the candle on the much be-muslined toilette-table, and,
      diving into his pocket for the key of the cellar, hurried off to make the
      final arrangement of a feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friend, however, who was always a dawdling leisurely gentleman, took
      very little heed of his host&rsquo;s injunctions, and proceeded to unlock and
      open his boxes as if he was going to dress for a ball instead of a dinner;
      and the whole party being reassembled, many were the Major&rsquo;s speculations
      and enquiries &ldquo;what could he be about?&rdquo; &ldquo;must have gone to bed,&rdquo; &ldquo;would go
      up and see,&rdquo; ere the glad sound of his opening door announced that he
      might be expected. And before he descended a single step of the staircase
      the Major gave the bell such a pull as proclaimed most volubly the
      intensity of his feelings. The ladies of course were shocked, but a hungry
      man is bad to hold, and there is no saying but the long-pealing tongue of
      the bell saved an explosion of the Major&rsquo;s. At all events when our friend
      came sauntering into the now illuminated drawing-room, the Major greeted
      him with, &ldquo;Heard you coming, rang the bell, knew you&rsquo;d be hungry, long
      drive from Sir Moses&rsquo;s here;&rdquo; to which Billy drawled a characteristic
      &ldquo;Yarse,&rdquo; as he extinguished his candle and proceeded to ingratiate himself
      with the now elegantly attired ladies, looking more lovely from his recent
      restriction to the male sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The furious peal of the bell had answered its purpose, for he had scarcely
      got the beauties looked over, and settled in his own mind that it was
      difficult to say which was the prettiest, ere the door opened, the
      long-postponed dinner was announced to be on the table, and the Major,
      having blown out the composites, gladly followed the ladies to the scene
      of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his host being too hungry to waste his time in apologies for the
      absence of this and that, and the footboy having plenty to do without
      giving the dishes superfluous airings, and the gooseberry champagne being
      both lively and cool, the dinner passed off as pleasantly as a luncheon,
      which is generally allowed to be the most agreeable sociable meal of the
      day, simply because of the absence of all fuss and pretension. And by the
      time the Major had got to the cheese, he found his temper considerably
      improved. Indeed, so rapidly did his spirits rise, that before the cloth
      was withdrawn he had well-nigh silenced all the ladies, with his
      marvellous haryers,&mdash;five and thirty years master of haryers without
      a subscription,&mdash;and as soon as he got the room cleared, he inflicted
      the whole hunt upon Billy that he had written to him about, an account of
      which he had in vain tried to get inserted in the Featherbedfordshire
      Gazette, through the medium of old &lsquo;Wotherspoon, who had copied it out and
      signed himself &ldquo;A Delighted Stranger.&rdquo; Dorsay Davis, however, knew his
      cramped handwriting, and put his manuscript into the fire, observing in
      his notice to correspondents that &ldquo;A Delighted Stranger&rdquo; had better send
      his currant jelly contributions to grandmamma, meaning the Hit-im and
      Hold-im shire Herald. So our friend was victimised into a <i>viva voce</i>
      account of this marvellous chase, beginning at Conksbury corner and the
      flight up to Foremark Hill and down over the water meadows to Dove-dale
      Green, &amp;c., interspersed with digressions and explanations of the
      wonderful performance of the particular members of the pack, until he
      scarcely knew whether a real run or the recital of one was the most
      formidable. At length the Major, having talked himself into a state of
      excitement, without making any apparent impression on his guest&rsquo;s obdurate
      understanding, proposed as a toast &ldquo;The Merry Haryers,&rdquo; and intimated that
      tea was ready in the drawing room, thinking he never had so phlegmatic an
      auditor before. Very different, however, was his conduct amid the general
      conversation of the ladies, who thought him just as agreeable as the Major
      thought him the contrary. And they were all quite surprised when the clock
      struck eleven, and declared they thought it could only be ten, except the
      Major, who knew the odd hour had been lost in preparing the dinner. So he
      moved an adjournment, and proclaimed that they would breakfast at nine,
      which would enable them to get to church in good time. Whereupon mutual
      good-nights were exchanged, our friend was furnished with a flat
      candlestick, and the elder sisters retired to talk him over in their own
      room; for however long ladies may be together during the day, there is
      always a great balance of conversation to dispose of at last, and so the
      two chatted and talked until midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning they all appeared in looped-up dresses, showing the
      party-coloured petticoats of the prevailing fashion, which looked
      extremely pretty, and were all very well&mdash;a great improvement on the
      draggletails&mdash;until they came to get into the coach, when it was
      found, that large as the vehicle was, it was utterly inadequate for their
      accommodation. Indeed the door seemed ludicrously insufficient for the
      ingress, and Miss Clara turned round and round like a peacock contending
      with the wind, undecided which way to make the attempt. At last she chose
      a bold sideways dash, and entered with a squeeze of the petticoat, which
      suddenly expanded into its original size, but when the sisters had
      followed her example there was no room for the Major, nor would there have
      been any for our hero had not Mamma been satisfied with her own natural
      size, and so left space to squeeze him in between herself and the fair
      Clara. The Major then had to mount the coach box beside old Solomon, and
      went growling and grumbling along at the extravagances of fashion, and
      wondering what the deuce those petticoats would cost, he was presently
      comforted by seeing two similar ones circling over the road in advance,
      which on overtaking proved to contain the elegant Miss Bushels, daughters
      of his hind at Bonnyrigs farm, whereupon he made a mental resolution to
      reduce Bushel&rsquo;s wages a shilling a week at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      This speedy influx of fashion and abundance of cheap tawdry finery has
      well nigh destroyed the primitive simplicity of country churches. The
      housemaid now dresses better&mdash;finer at all events&mdash;than her
      mistress did twenty years ago, and it is almost impossible to recognise
      working people when in their Sunday dresses. Gauze bonnets, Marabout
      feathers, lace scarfs, and silk gowns usurp the place of straw and cotton
      print, while lace-fringed kerchiefs are flourished by those whose parents
      scarcely knew what a pocket-handkerchief was. There is a medium in all
      things, but this mania for dress has got far beyond the bounds of either
      prudence or propriety; and we think the Major&rsquo;s recipe for reducing it is
      by no means a bad one.

      We need scarcely say, that our hero&rsquo;s appearance at church caused no small
      sensation in a neighbourhood where the demand for gossip was far in excess
      of the supply. Indeed, we fear many fair ladies&rsquo; eyes were oftener
      directed to Major Yammerton&rsquo;s pew than to the Reverend Mr. Tightlace in
      the pulpit. Wonderful were the stories and exaggerations that ensued,
      people always being on the running-up tack until a match is settled, after
      which, of course, they assume the running-down one, pitying one or other
      victim extremely&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t be him or her for anything&mdash;Mr.
      Tightlace thought any of the young ladies might do better than marry a
      mere fox-hunter, though we are sorry to add that the fox-hunter was far
      more talked of than the sermon. The general opinion seemed to be that our
      hero had been away preparing that dread document, the proposals for a
      settlement; and there seemed to be very little doubt that there would be
      an announcement of some sort in a day or two&mdash;especially when our
      friend was seen to get into the carriage after the gay petticoats, and the
      little Major to remount the box seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when at the accustomed stable stroll our master of haryers found the
      gallant grey standing in the place of the bay, he was much astonished, and
      not a little shocked to learn the sad catastrophe that had befallen the
      bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he never heard anything like that!&mdash;<i>dead</i>! What, do you
      mean to say he absolutely died on your hands without any apparent cause?&rdquo;
       demanded the Major; &ldquo;must have been poisoned surely;&rdquo; and he ran about
      telling everybody, and making as much to do as if the horse had still been
      his own. He then applied himself to finding out how Billy came by the
      grey, and was greatly surprised to learn that Sir Moses had given it him.
      &ldquo;Well, that was queer,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t have accused him of that.&rdquo;
       And he thought of the gift of Little Bo-peep, and wondered whether this
      gift was of the same order.

      CHAPTER LI.<br/>MONEY AND MATRIMONY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ONEY and
      matrimony! what a fine taking title! If that does not attract readers, we
      don&rsquo;t know what will. Money and matrimony! how different, yet how
      essentially combined, how intimately blended! &ldquo;No money, no matrimony,&rdquo;
       might almost be written above some doors. Certainly money is an essential,
      but not so absorbing an essential as some people make it. Beyond the
      expenditure necessary for a certain establishment, a woman is seldom much
      the better for her husband&rsquo;s inordinate wealth. We have seen the wife of a
      reputed millionaire no better done by than that of a country squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Prospero Plutus may gild his coach and his harness, and his horses
      too, if he likes, but all the lacker in the world will not advance him a
      step in society; therefore, what can he do with his surplus cash but carry
      it to the &ldquo;reserve fund,&rdquo; as some Joint-Stock Bankers pretend to do. Still
      there is a money-worship among us, that is not even confined to the
      opposite sex, but breaks out in veneration among men, just as if one man
      having half a million or a million pieces of gold could be of any
      advantage to another man, who only knows the rich man to say &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye
      do?&rdquo; to. A clever foreigner, who came to this country some years ago for
      the honestly avowed purpose of marrying an heiress, used to exclaim, when
      any one told him that another man had so many thousands a year, &ldquo;Vell, my
      good friend, vot for that to me? I cannot go for be marry to him!&rdquo; and we
      never hear a man recommended to another man for his wealth alone, without
      thinking of our foreign friend. What earthly good can Plutus&rsquo;s money do
      us? We can safely say, we never knew a rich man who was not uncommonly
      well able to take care of his cash. It is your poor men who are easy about
      money. To tell a young lady that a young gentleman has so many thousands a
      year is very different; and this observation leads us to say, that people
      who think they do a young man a kindness by exaggerating his means or
      expectations, are greatly mistaken. On the contrary, they do him an
      injury; for, sooner or later, the lawyers know everything, and
      disappointment and vexation is the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since our friend Warren wrote his admirable novel, &ldquo;Ten Thousand a Year,&rdquo;
       that sum has become the fashionable income for exaggerators. Nobody that
      has anything a year has less, though we all know how difficult a sum it is
      to realise, and how impossible it is to extract a five-pound note, or even
      a sovereign, from the pockets of people who talk of it as a mere
      bagatelle. This money mania has increased amazingly within the last few
      years, aided, no doubt, by the gigantic sums the Joint-Stock Banks have
      enabled penniless people to &ldquo;go&rdquo; for.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Wainwright, the first of the assurance office defrauders by poison,
      was in prison, he said to a person who called upon him, &ldquo;You see with what
      respect they treat me. They don&rsquo;t set me to make my bed, or sweep the
      yard, like those fellows,&rdquo; pointing to his brother prisoners; &ldquo;no, they
      treat me like a gentleman. They think I&rsquo;m in for ten thousand pounds.&rdquo; Ten
      thousand pounds! What would ten thousand pounds be nowadays, when men
      speculate to the extent of a quarter or may be half a million of money?
      Why Wainwright would have had to clean out the whole prison on the present
      scale of money delinquency. A hundred thousand pounder is quite a common
      fellow, hardly worth speaking of. There was a time when the greediest man
      was contented with his plum. Now the cry is &ldquo;More! more!&rdquo; until some fine
      morning the crier is &ldquo;no more&rdquo; himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This money-craving and boasting is all bad. It deceives young men, and
      drives those of moderate income into the London clubs, instead of their
      marrying and settling quietly as their fathers did before them. They hear
      of nothing but thousands and tens of thousands until they almost believe
      in the reality, and are ashamed to encounter the confessional stool of the
      lawyers, albeit they may have as much as with prudence and management
      would make married life comfortable. Boasting and exaggeration also
      greatly misleads and disappoints anxious &ldquo;Mammas,&rdquo; all ready to believe
      whatever they like, causing very likely promising speculations to be
      abandoned in favour of what turn out great deal worse ventures. Only let a
      young man be disengaged, professionally and bodily, and some one or other
      will be sure to invest him with a fortune, or with surprising expectations
      from an uncle, an aunt, or other near relation. It is surprising how fond
      people are of fanning the flame of a match, and how they will talk about
      what they really know nothing, until an unfortunate youth almost appears
      to participate in their exaggerations. Could some of these Leviathans of
      fortune know the fabulous £ s. d. colours under which they have sailed,
      they would be wonderfully astonished at the extent of their innocent
      imposture. Yet they were not to blame because people said they had ten
      thousand a year, were richest commoners in fact. Many would then
      understand much unexplained politeness, and appreciate its
      disinterestedness at its true value. Captain Quaver would see why Mrs.
      Sunnybrow was to anxious that he should hear Matilda sing; Mr. Grist why
      Mrs. Snubwell manoeuvred to get him next Bridget at dinner; and perhaps
      our &ldquo;Richest Commoner&rdquo; why Mrs. Yammerton was so glad to see him back at
      the Grange.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII.<br/>A NIGHT DRIVE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>EOPLE who travel
      in the winter should remember it isn&rsquo;t summer, and time themselves
      accordingly. Sir Moses was so anxious to see Monsieur Rougier off the
      premises, in order to stop any extra hospitality, that he delayed starting
      for Lundyfoote Castle until he saw him fairly mounted on the gift grey and
      out of the stable-yard; he then had the mare put to the dog-cart, and
      tried to make up for lost time by extra speed upon the road. But winter is
      an unfavourable season for expedition; if highways are improving,
      turnpikes are getting neglected, save in the matter of drawing the
      officers&rsquo; sinecure salaries, and, generally speaking, the nearer a
      turnpike is to a railway, the worse the turnpike is, as if to show the
      wonderful advantage of the former. So Sir Moses went flipping and
      flopping, and jipping and jerking, through Bedland and Hawksworth and
      Washingley-field, but scarcely reached the confines of his country when he
      ought to have been nearing the Castle. It was nearly four o&rsquo;clock by the
      great gilt-lettered clock on the diminutive church in the pretty village
      of Tidswell, situated on the banks of the sparkling Lune, when he pulled
      up at the sign of the Hold-away Harriers to get his mare watered and fed.
      It is at these sort of places that the traveller gets the full benefit of
      country slowness and stupidity. Instead of the quick ostler, stepping
      smartly up to his horse&rsquo;s head as he reins up, there is generally a hunt
      through the village for old Tom, or young Joe, or some worthy who is
      either too old or too idle to work. In this case it was old bow-legged,
      wiry Tom Brown, whose long experience of the road did not enable him to
      anticipate a person&rsquo;s wants; so after a good stare at the driver, whom at
      first he thought was Mr. Meggison, the exciseman; then Mr. Puncheon, the
      brewer; and lastly, Mr. Mossman, Lord Polkaton&rsquo;s ruler; he asked, with a
      bewildered scratch of his head, &ldquo;What, de ye want her put oop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oop, yes,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses; &ldquo;what d&rsquo;ye think I&rsquo;m stopping for? Look
      alive; that&rsquo;s a good fellow,&rdquo; added he, throwing him the reins, as he
      prepared to descend from the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Sir Moses, is it,&rdquo; rejoined the now enlightened patriarch,
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you without your red coat and cap;&rdquo; so saying, he began to
      fumble at the harness, and, with the aid of the Baronet, presently had the
      mare out of the shafts. It then occurred to the old gentleman that he had
      forgotten the key of the stable. &ldquo;A sink,&rdquo; said he, with a dash of his
      disengaged hand, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve left the key i&rsquo; the pocket o&rsquo; mar coat, down i&rsquo; 
      Willy Wood&rsquo;s shop, when ar was helpin&rsquo; to kill a pig&mdash;run, lad, doon
      to Willy Wood,&rdquo; said he to a staring by-standing boy, &ldquo;and get me mar
      coat,&rdquo; adding to Sir Moses, as the lad slunk unwillingly away, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be
      back directly wi&rsquo; it.&rdquo; So saying, he proceeded to lead the mare round to
      the stable at the back of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the coat came, then there was no pail; and when they got a pail, then
      the pump had gone dry; and when they got some water from the well, then
      the corn had to be brought from the top of the house; so, what with one
      delay and another, day was about done before Sir Moses got the mare out of
      the stable again. Night comes rapidly on in the short winter months, and
      as Sir Moses looked at the old-fashioned road leading over the steepest
      part of the opposite hill, he wished he was well on the far side of it. He
      then examined his lamps, and found there were no candles in them, just as
      he remembered that he had never been to Lundyfoote Castle on wheels, the
      few expeditions he had made there having been performed on horseback, by
      those nicks and cuts that fox-hunters are so famous at making and finding.
      &ldquo;Ord dom it,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;I shall be getting benighted. Tell me,&rdquo;
       continued he, addressing the old ostler, &ldquo;do I go by Marshfield and
      Hengrove, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, you&rsquo;ve no business at noughter Marshfield nor Hengrove,&rdquo;
       interrupted the sage; &ldquo;veer way is straight oop to Crowfield-hall and
      Roundhill-green, then to Brackley Moor and Belton, and so on into the
      Sandywell-road at Langley. But if ar were you,&rdquo; continued he, beginning to
      make confusion worse confounded, &ldquo;ar would just gan through Squire
      Patterson&rsquo;s Park here,&rdquo; jerking his thumb to the left to indicate the
      direction in which it lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it shorter?&rdquo; demanded Sir Moses, re-ascending the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-h-o-y no, it&rsquo;s not shorter,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a better road
      rayther&mdash;less agin collar-like. When ye get to the new lodge ye mun
      mind turn to the right, and keep Whitecliffe Law to the left, and Lidney
      Mill to the right, you then pass Shimlow tilery, and make straight for
      Roundhill Green, and Brackley Moor, and then on to Belton, as ar toll&rsquo;d ye
      afoor&mdash;ye can&rsquo;t miss yeer way,&rdquo; added he, thinking he could go it in
      the dark himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, drawing the reins. He then chucked the man a
      shilling, and touching the mare with the point of the whip, trotted across
      the bridge over the Lane, and was speedily brought up at a toll-bar on the
      far side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to be one of the ordinances of country life, that the more toll a
      man pays the worse road he gets, and Sir Moses had scarcely parted with
      his sixpence ere the sound running turnpike which tempted him past Squire
      Patterson&rsquo;s lodge, ran out into a loose, river-stoned track, that grew
      worse and worse the higher he ascended the hill. In vain he hissed, and
      jerked, and jagged at the mare. The wheels revolved as if they were going
      through sea-sand. She couldn&rsquo;t go any faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is labour and sorrow travelling on wheels, with a light horse and a
      heavy load, on woolly winter roads, especially under the depressing
      influence of declining day&mdash;when a gorgeous sunset has no charms. It
      is then that the value of the hissing, hill-rounding, plain-scudding
      railway is appreciated. The worst line that ever was constructed, even one
      with goods, passengers, and minerals all mixed in one train, is fifty
      times better than one of these ploughing, sobbing, heart-breaking drives.
      So thought Sir Moses, as, whip in hand, he alighted from the vehicle to
      ease the mare up the steep hill, which now ran parallel with Mr.
      Patterson&rsquo;s rather indifferent park wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a commentary on consequence a drive across country affords, One sees
      life in all its phases&mdash;Cottage, House, Grange, &ldquo;Imperial John&rdquo; Hall,
      Park, Tower, Castle, &amp;c. The wall, however, is the true index of the
      whole. Show me your wall and I&rsquo;ll tell you what you have. There is the
      five hundred&mdash;by courtesy, thousand&mdash;a year wall, built of
      common stone, well embedded in mortar, extending only a few yards on
      either side of the lodgeless green gate. The thousand&mdash;by courtesy,
      fifteen hundred&mdash;a year wall, made of the same material, only the
      mortar ceases at the first convenient bend of the road, and the mortared
      round coping of the top is afterwards all that holds it together. Then
      there is the aspiring block and course wall, leading away with a sweep
      from either side of a handsome gateway, but suddenly terminating in
      hedges. The still further continued wall, with an abrupt juncture in split
      oak paling, that looks as if it had been suddenly nipped by a want-of-cash
      frost. We then get to the more successful all-round-the-park alike efforts
      of four or five thousand a-year&mdash;the still more solid masonry and
      ornamental work of &ldquo;Ten Thousand a Year,&rdquo; a Warren wall in fact, until at
      length we come to one so strong and so high, that none but a man on a
      laden wain can see over it, which of course denotes a Ducal residence,
      with fifty or a hundred thousand a year. In like manner, a drive across
      country enables a man to pick up information without the trouble of asking
      for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board against the tree at the corner of the larch plantation, stating
      that &ldquo;Any one trespassing on these grounds, the property of A. B. C.
      Sowerby, Esq., will, &amp;c., with the utmost, &amp;c.,&rdquo; enables one to
      jump to the conclusion that the Westmoreland-slated roof we see peering
      among the eagle-winged cedars and luxuriant Scotch firs on the green slope
      to the left, is the residence of said Sowerby, who doesn&rsquo;t like to be
      trespassed upon. A quick-eyed land-agent would then trace the boundaries
      of the Sowerby estate from the rising ground, either by the size of its
      trees, its natural sterility, or by the rough, gateless fences, where it
      adjoins the neighbouring proprietors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the sign of the Smith Arms at a wayside public-house, denotes that
      some member of that illustrious family either lives or has property in
      that immediate neighbourhood, and as everybody has a friend Smith, we
      naturally set about thinking whether it is our friend Smith or not. So a
      nobleman&rsquo;s coronet surmounting his many-quartered coat-of-arms, suggests
      that the traveller is in the neighbourhood of magnificence; and if his
      appearance is at all in his favour, he will, perhaps, come in for a touch,
      or a demi-touch, of the hat from the passers-by, the process being almost
      mechanical in aristocratic parts. A board at a branch road with the words
      &ldquo;To Lavender Lodge only,&rdquo; saves one the trouble of asking the name of the
      place towards which we see the road bending, while a great deal of curious
      nomenclature may be gleaned from shop-fronts, inn-signs, and cart-shafts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are leaving Sir Moses toiling up the hill alongside of his
      dog-cart, looking now at his watch, now at his jaded mare, now at Mr.
      Patterson&rsquo;s fragile park wall, thinking how he would send it over with his
      shoulder if he came to it out hunting. The wall was at length abruptly
      terminated by a cross-road intersecting the hill along a favourable fall
      of the ground, about the middle of it, and the mare and Sir Moses mutually
      stopped, the former to ease herself on the piece of level ground at the
      junction, the latter to consider whether his course was up the hill or
      along the more inviting line to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marshfield,&rdquo; muttered he to himself, &ldquo;is surely that way, but then that
      old buffer said I had no business at Marshfield. Dom the old man,&rdquo;
       continued he, &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never asked him anything about it, for he has
      completely bewildered me, and I believe I could have found my way better
      without.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Sir Moses reconnoitered the scene; the balance of the fat hill
      in front, with the drab-coloured road going straight up the steepest part
      of it, the diverging lines either way; above all, the fast closing canopy
      around. Across the road, to the right, was a paintless, weather-beaten
      finger-post, and though our friend saw it had lost two of its arms, he yet
      thought the remaining ones might give him some information. Accordingly,
      he went over to consult it. Not a word, no, not a letter was legible.
      There were some upright marks, but what they had stood for it was
      impossible to decipher. Sir Moses was nonplussed. Just at this critical
      moment, a rumbling sound proceeded from below, and looking down the hill,
      a grey speck loomed in the distance, followed by a darker one a little
      behind. This was consoling; for those who know how soon an agricultural
      country becomes quiet after once the labourers go to their homes can
      appreciate the boon of any stirrers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the carts came very slowly, and the quick falling shades of night
      travelled faster than they. Sir Moses stood listening anxiously to their
      jolting noises, thinking they would never come up. At the same time, he
      kept a sharp eye on the cross-road, to intercept any one passing that way.
      A tinker, a poacher, a mugger, the veriest scamp, would have been welcome,
      so long as he knew the country. No one, however, came along. It was an
      unfrequented line; and old Gilbert Price, who worked by the day, always
      retired from raking in the mud ruts on the approach of evening. So Sir
      Moses stood staring and listening, tapping his boot with his whip, as he
      watched the zig-zag course of the grey up the hill. He seemed a good
      puller, and to understand his work, for as yet no guiding voice had been
      heard. Perhaps the man was behind. As there is always a stout pull just
      before a resting-place, the grey now came to a pause, to collect his
      energies for the effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses looked at his mare, and then at the carts halting below,
      wondering whether if he left her she would take off. Just as he determined
      to risk it, the grey applied himself vigorously to the collar, and with a
      grinding, ploughing rush, came up to where Sir Moses stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cart was empty, but there was a sack-like thing, with a wide-awake hat
      on the top, rolling in the one behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloo, my man!&rdquo; shouted Sir Moses, with the voice of a Stentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wide-awake merely nodded to the motion of the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Holloo, I say!</i>&rdquo; roared he, still louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      An extended arm was thrown over the side of the cart, and the wide-awake
      again nodded as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beggar&rsquo;s asleep!&rdquo; muttered Sir Moses, taking the butt-end of his
      whip, and poking the somnambulist severely in the stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud grunt, and with a strong smell of gin, as the monster changed his
      position, was all that answered the appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brute&rsquo;s drunk,&rdquo; gasped Sir Moses, indignant at having wasted so much
      time in waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sober grey then made a well-rounded turn to the right, followed by the
      one in the rear, leaving our friend enveloped in many more shades of
      darkness than he was when he first designed him coming. Night had indeed
      about closed in, and lights began to appear in cottages and farm-houses
      that sparsedly dotted the hill side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a pretty go,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, remounting the dogcart, and
      gathering up the reins; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just give the mare her choice,&rdquo; continued
      he, touching her with the whip, and letting her go. The sensible animal
      took the level road to the left, and Sir Moses&rsquo;s liberality was at first
      rewarded by an attempted trot along it, which, however, soon relaxed into
      a walk. The creaking, labouring vehicle shook and rolled with the
      concussion of the ruts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had got upon a piece of township road, where each surveyor shuffled
      through his year of office as best he could, filling up the dangerous
      holes in summer with great boulder stones that turned up like flitches of
      bacon in winter. So Sir Moses rolled and rocked in imminent danger of an
      upset. To add to his misfortunes, he was by no means sure but that he
      might have to retrace his steps: it was all chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are but two ways of circumventing a hill, either by going round it
      or over it; and the road, after evading it for some time, at length took a
      sudden turn to the right, and grappled fairly with its severity. The mare
      applied herself sedulously to her task, apparently cheered by the
      increasing lights on the hill. At length she neared them, and the radiant
      glow of a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop cheered the drooping spirit of the traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloo, my man!&rdquo; cried Sir Moses, at length, pulling up before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloo!&rdquo; responded the spark-showering Vulcan from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the way to Lord Lundyfoote&rsquo;s?&rdquo; demanded Sir Moses, knowing the
      weight a nobleman&rsquo;s name carries in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Lundyfoote&rsquo;s!&rdquo; exclaimed Osmand Hall, pausing in his work; &ldquo;Lord
      Lundyfoote&rsquo;s!&rdquo; repeated he; &ldquo;why, where ha&rsquo; you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tidswell,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, cutting off the former part of the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what set ye this way?&rdquo; demanded the dark man, coming to the door
      with a red-hot horse-shoe on a spike, which was nearly all that
      distinguished him from the gloom of night; &ldquo;ye should never ha&rsquo; coom&rsquo;d
      this way; ye should ha&rsquo; gone by Marshfield and Hengrove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dom it, I said so!&rdquo; ejaculated the Baronet, nearly stamping the bottom of
      his gig out with vexation. &ldquo;However, never mind,&rdquo; continued he,
      recollecting himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here now, so tell me the best way to proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This information being at length accorded, Sir Moses proceeded; and the
      rest of the hill being duly surmounted, the dancing and stationary lights
      spreading o&rsquo;er the far-stretching vale now appeared before him, with a
      clustering constellation, amid many minor stars scattered around, denoting
      the whereabouts of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is always cheering to see the far end of a journey, distant though the
      haven be, and Sir Moses put on as fast as his lampless condition would
      allow him, trusting to his eyes and his ears for keeping on the road. Very
      much surprised would he have been had he retraced his steps the next
      morning, and seen the steep banks and yawning ditches he had suddenly
      saved himself from going over or into by catching at the reins or feeling
      either wheel running in the soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he reached the lodges of the massive variously-windowed castle,
      and passing gladly through them, found, on alighting at the door, that,
      instead of being late for dinner as he anticipated, his Lordship, who
      always ate a hearty lunch, was generally very easy about the matter,
      sometimes dining at seven, sometimes at eight, sometimes in summer even at
      nine o&rsquo;clock. The footman, in reply to Sir Moses inquiring what time his
      Lordship dined, said he believed it was ordered at seven, but he didn&rsquo;t
      know when it would be on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being an ardent politician, Lord Lundyfoote received Sir Moses with the
      fellow-feeling that makes us wondrous kind cordiality, and dived so
      energetically into his subject, as soon as he got the weather disposed of,
      as never to wait for an answer to his question, whether his guest would
      like to take anything before dinner, the consequence of which was, that
      our poor friend was nearly famished with waiting. In vain the library
      time-piece ticked, and chimed, and struck; jabber, jabber, jabber, went
      his voluble Lordship; in vain the deep-toned castle-clock reverberated
      through the walls&mdash;on, on he went, without noticing it, until the
      butler, in apparent despair, took the gong, and gave it such a beating
      just outside the door, that he could scarcely hear himself speak. Sir
      Moses then adroitly slipped in the question if that was the signal for
      dressing; to which his Lordship having yielded a reluctant &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he took
      a candle from the entering footman, and pioneered the Baronet up to his
      bedroom, amid a running commentary on the state of the country and the
      stability of the ministry. And when he returned he found his Lordship
      distributing his opinions amoung an obsequious circle of neighbours, who
      received all he said with the deference due to a liberal dispenser of
      venison; so that Sir Moses not only got his dinner in comparative peace,
      but warded his Lordship off the greater part of the evening.

      used to be thought a great luxury in London, though somehow great people
      were often shy of availing themselves of its advantages, indeed of taking
      their two-penny-posters in. &ldquo;Two-penny-posters,&rdquo; circulars, and ticketed
      shops, used to be held in about equal repugnance by some. The Dons, never
      thought of sending their notes or cards of invitation by the two-penny
      post. John Thomas used always to be trotted out for the purpose of
      delivery. Pre-paying a letter either by the two-penny post or the general
      used to be thought little short of an insult. Public opinion has undergone
      a great change in these matters. Not paying them is now the offence. We
      need scarcely expatiate on the boon of the penny post, nor on the
      advantage of the general diffusion of post-offices throughout the country,
      though we may observe, that the penny post was one of the few things that
      came without being long called for: indeed, so soon as it was practicable
      to have it, for without the almost simultaneous establishment of railways
      it would have been almost impossible to have introduced the system. The
      mail could not have carried the newspaper traffic and correspondence of
      the present day. The folded tablecloths of <i>Times</i>, the voluminous <i>Illustrated
      News</i>, the <i>Punch&rsquo;s,</i> the huge avalanches of papers that have
      broken upon the country within the last twenty years. Sir Moses
      Mainchance, unlike many country gentlemen, always had his letters
      forwarded to him where-ever he went. He knew it was only the trouble of
      writing a line to the Post-office, saying re-direct my letters to
      so-and-so, to have what he wanted, and thus to keep pace with his
      correspondence. He was never overpowered with letters when he came home
      from a visit or tour, as some of our acquaintance are, thus making writing
      doubly repugnant to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning after his arrival at Lundyfoote Castle brought him a great
      influx of re-directed letters and papers. One from Mr. Heslop, asking him
      to meet at his house on the Friday week following, as he was going to have
      a party, one from Signior Quaverini, the eminent musician, offering his
      services for the Hunt ball: one from Mr. Isinglass, the confectioner,
      hoping to be allowed to supply the ices and refreshment as usual; another
      (the fifth), from Mr. Mossman, about the damage to Mr. Anthill&rsquo;s sown
      grass; an envelope, enclosing the card and terms of Signior Dulcetto, an
      opposition musician, offering lower terras than Quaverini; a note from Mr.
      Paul Straddler, telling him about a horse to be bought dog cheap; and a
      &ldquo;dead letter office&rdquo; envelope, enclosing a blue ink written letter,
      directed to Master Anthony Thom, at the Inn-in-the-Sands Inn, Beechwood
      Green, stating that the party was not known at the address, reintroduces
      Mr. Geordey Gallon, a gentleman already known to the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      How this letter came to be sent to Sir Moses was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Geordey Gallon went upon the &ldquo;Torf,&rdquo; as he calls it, becoming, as
      he considered, the associate of Princes, Prime Ministers, and so on, he
      bethought him of turning respectable, and giving up the
      stolen-goods-carrying-trade,&mdash;a resolution that he was further
      confirmed in by the establishment of that troublesome obnoxious corps the
      Hit-im-and-Hold-im-shire Rural Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end, therefore, he gradually reduced the number of his
      Tippy-Tom-jaunts through the country by night, intimating to his numerous
      patrons that they had better suit themselves elsewhere ere he ceased
      travelling altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the inconvenienced, was our old friend Mrs. Margerum, long one of
      his most regular customers; for it was a very rare thing for Mr. Gallon
      not to find a carefully stitched-up bundle in the corner of Lawyer
      Hindmarch&rsquo;s cattle-shed, abutting on the Shillburn road as he passed in
      his spring cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      To remedy this serious inconvenience, Mrs. Margerum had determined upon
      inducting her adopted son, Master Anthony Thom, into the
      about-to-be-relinquished business; and Mr. Gallon having made his last
      journey, the accumulation of dripping caused by our hero&rsquo;s visit to
      Pangburn Park made it desirable to have a clearing-out as soon as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end, therefore, she had written the letter now sent to Sir Moses;
      but, being a very prudent woman, with a slight smattering of law, she
      thought so long as she did not sign her surname at the end she was safe,
      and that no one could prove that it was from her. The consequence was,
      that Anthony Thom not having shifted his quarters as soon as intended, the
      letter was refused at the sign of the Sun-in-the-Sands, and by dint of
      postmark and contents, with perhaps a little <i>malice prepense</i> on the
      part of the Post-master, who had suffered from a dishonest housekeeper
      himself, it came into the hands of Sir Moses. At first our master of the
      hounds thought it was a begging-letter, and threw it aside accordingly;
      but in course of casting about for a fresh idea wherewith to propitiate
      Mr. Mossman about the sown grass, his eye rested upon the writing, which
      he glanced at, and glanced at, until somehow he thought he had seen it
      before. At length he took the letter up, and read what made him stare very
      much as he proceeded. Thus it run:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PANGBURN PARK, Thursday Night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own ever dear Anthony Thom,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I write to you, trusting you will receive this safe, to say that as
      Mr. George Gallon has discontinued travelling altogether, I must trust to
      you entirely to do what is necessary in futur, but you must be most
      careful and watchful, for these nasty Pollis fellers are about every
      where, and seem to think they have a right to look into every bodies
      basket and bundle. We live in terrible times, I&rsquo;m sure, my own beloved
      Anthony Thom, and if it wasn&rsquo;t for the hope that I may see you become a
      great gentleman, like Mr. George Gallon, I really think I would forswear
      place altogether, for no one knows the anxiety and misery of living with
      such a nasty, mean, covetous body as Old Nosey.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Nosey!&rdquo; ejaculated Sir Moses, stopping short in his reading, and
      feeling his proboscis; &ldquo;Old Nosey! dom it, can that mean me? Do believe it
      does&mdash;and it&rsquo;s mother Margerum&rsquo;s handwriting&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if it
      isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; continued he, holding the letter a little way off to examine and
      catch the character of the writing; &ldquo;What does she mean by calling me a
      nasty, covetous body? I that hunt the country, subscribe to the Infirmary,
      Agricultural Society, and do everything that&rsquo;s liberal and handsome. I&rsquo;ll
      Old Nosey her!&rdquo; continued he, grinding his teeth, and giving a vigorous
      flourish of his right fist; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Old Nosey her! I&rsquo;ll turn her out of the
      house as soon as ever I get home, dom&rsquo;d if I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Sir Moses
      quivering with rage as he spoke. At length he became sufficiently composed
      to resume his reading&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;-<i>No one knows the anxiety and misery of living with such a nasty,
      mean, covetous body as Old Nosey, who is always on the fret about expense,
      and thinks everybody is robbing him.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dom it, that means me sure enough!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s on
      account of the row I was kicking up t&rsquo;other day about the tea&mdash;declared
      I drank a pound a week myself. I&rsquo;ll tea her!&rdquo; continued he, again turning
      to the letter and reading,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;-<i>I declare I&rsquo;d almost as soon live under a mistress as under such a
      shocking mean, covetous man.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; muttered Sir Moses; adding, &ldquo;you shall very soon have a
      chance then.&rdquo; The letter thus continued,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;-<i>The old feller will be away on Saturday and Sunday, so come afore
      lightning on Monday morning, say about four o&rsquo;clock, and I&rsquo;ll have
      everything ready to lower from my window</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh the deuce!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, slapping his leg; &ldquo;Oh the deuce!
      going to rob the house, I declare!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;-<i>To lower from my window</i>&rdquo; read he again, &ldquo;<i>for it&rsquo;s not safe
      trusting things by the door as we used to do, now that these nasty knavish
      Pollis fellers are about; so now my own beloved Anthony Thom, if you will
      give a gentle whistle, or throw a little bit of soft dirt up at the
      window, where you will see a light burning, I&rsquo;ll be ready for you, and
      you&rsquo;ll be clear of the place long afore any of the lazy fellers here are
      up,&mdash;for a set of nastier, dirtier drunkards never were gathered
      together.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Sir Moses, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a cut at Mr. Findlater.&rdquo; The writer
      then proceeded to say,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>&mdash;But mind my own beloved Anthony Thom, if any body questions
      you, say it&rsquo;s a parcel of dripping, and tell them they are welcome to
      look in if they like, which is the readiest way of stopping them from
      doing so. We have had a large party here, including a young gent from that
      fine old Lord Ladythorne, who I would dearly like to live with, and also
      that nasty, jealous, covetous body Cuddy Flintoff, peeping and prying
      about everywhere as usual. He deserves to have a dish-clout pinned to his
      tail</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He, he, he!</i>&rdquo; chuckled Sir Moses, as he read it
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;-<i>I shall direct this letter by post to you at the sign of the Sun in
      the Sands, unless I can get it conveyed by a private hand. I am half in
      hopes Mr. Gallon may call, as there is going to be a great steeple match
      for an immense sum of money, £200 they say, and they will want his fine
      judgment to direct matters. Mr. Gallon is indeed a man of a thousand</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Sir Moses, adding, &ldquo;we are getting behind the curtain
      now.&rdquo; He then went on reading,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;<i>Oh my own dear darling Anthony Thom! what would I give to see
      you a fine gentleman like Mr. George Gallon. I do hope and trust, dearest,
      that it may yet come to pass; but we must make money, and take care of our
      money when made, for a man is nothing without money. What a noble example
      you have before you in Mr. George Gallon! He was once no better nor you,
      and now he has everything like a gentleman,&mdash;a hunting horse to ride
      on, gold studs in his shirt, and goose for his dinner. O my own beloved
      Anthony Thom, if I could but see you on a white horse, with a flowered
      silk tie, and a cut velvet vest with bright steel buttons, flourishing a
      silver-mounted whip, how glad, how rejoiced it would make me. Then I
      shouldn&rsquo;t care for the pryings and grumblings of Old Nosey, or the jealous
      watchings of the nasty, waspish set with which one is surrounded, for I
      should say my Anthony Thom will revenge and protect me, and make me
      comfortable at last. So now my own dearest Anthony Thom, be careful and
      guarded in coming about here, for I dread those nasty lurkin Pollis men
      more nor can I say, for I never knew suspicious people what were good for
      any thing themselves; and how they ever come to interduce such nasty town
      pests into the quiet peaceful country, I can&rsquo;t for the life of me imagine;
      but Mr. George Gallon, who is a man of great intellect, says they are
      dangerous, and that is partly why he has given up travelling; so therefore
      my own dearest Anthony Thom be guarded, and mind put on your pee jacket
      and red worsted comforter, for I dread these hoar frosts, and I&rsquo;ll have
      everything ready for my darling pet, so that you won&rsquo;t be kept waiting a
      moment; but mind if there&rsquo;s snow on the ground you don&rsquo;t come for fear of
      the tracks. I think I have littel more to say this time, my own darling
      Anthony Thom, except that I am, my own dear, dear son, </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ever loving mother,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-o-o-y Jove!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, sousing himself down in an easy chair
      beside the table at which he had been writing &ldquo;b-o-y Jove, what a
      production! Regular robber, dom&rsquo;d if she&rsquo;s not. Would give something to
      catch Master Anthony Thom, in his red worsted comforter, with his parcel
      of dripping. Would see whether I&rsquo;d look into it or not. And Mr. Geordey
      Gallon, too! The impudent fellow who pretended not to know the Frenchman.
      Regular plant as ever was made. Will see whether he gets his money from
      me. Ten punds the wretch tried to do me out of by the basest deceit that
      ever was heard of. Con-found them, but I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t be upsides with
      them all though,&rdquo; continued he, writhing for vengeance. And the whole of
      that day, and most of that night, and the whole of the following day when
      hunting at Harker Crag, he was thinking how he could manage it. At length,
      as he was going quietly home with the hounds, after only an indifferent
      day&rsquo;s sport, a thought struck him which he proceeded to put in execution
      as soon as he got into the house. He wrote a note to dear Lord Repartee,
      saying, if it would be quite convenient to Lady Repartee and his Lordship,
      he would be glad to stay all night with them before hunting Filberton
      forest; and leaving the unfolded note on the library table to operate
      during the night, he wrote a second one in the morning, inquiring the
      character of a servant; and putting the first note into the fire, he
      sealed the second one, and laid it ostentatiously on the hall table for
      the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take it we all have some ambitious feeling to gratify&mdash;all have
      some one whom we either wish to visit, or who we desire should visit us.
      We will candidly state that our ambition is to dine with the Lord Mayor.
      If we could but achieve that great triumph, we really think we should rest
      satisfied the rest of our life. We know how it would elevate us in the
      eyes of such men as Cuddy Flintoff and Paul Straddler, and what an
      advantage it would be to us in society being able to talk in a familiar
      way of his Lordship (Lordship with a capital L., if you please, Mr.
      Printer).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the world proceeds on the aspiring scale, each man looking to the
      class a little in advance of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O knew they but their happiness, of men the happiest&rdquo; are the sporting
      country gentlemen who live at home at ease&mdash;unvexed alike with the
      torments of the money-maker and the anxieties of the great, and yet
      sufficiently informed and refined to be the companions of either&mdash;men
      who see and enjoy nature in all her moods and varieties, and live
      unfettered with the pomp and vexation of keeping up appearances, envying
      no one, whoever may envy them. If once a man quits this happy rank to
      breast the contending billows of party in hopes of rising to the one above
      it, what a harvest of discord he sows for his own reaping. If a man wants
      to be thoroughly disgusted with human nature, let him ally himself
      unreservedly to a political party. He will find cozening and sneaking and
      selfishness in all their varieties, and patriotic false pretences in their
      most luxuriant growth. But we are getting in advance of our subject, our
      thesis being Mr. and Mrs. Wotherspoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our snuffy friend Spoon was not exempt from the ambitious failings of
      lesser men. His great object of ambition was to get Major Yammerton to
      visit him&mdash;or perhaps to put it more correctly, his great object of
      ambition was to visit Major Yammerton. But then, unfortunately, it
      requires two parties to these bargains; and Mrs. Yammerton wouldn&rsquo;t agree
      to it, not so much because old Spoon had been a butler, but because his
      wife (our pen splutters as it writes the objection) his wife had been a&mdash;a&mdash;housekeeper.
      A handsome housekeeper she was, too, when she first came into the country;
      so handsome, indeed, that Dicky Boggledike had made two excursions over to
      their neighbour, Farmer Flamstead, to see her, and had reported upon her
      very favourably to the noble Earl his august master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mrs. Yammerton wouldn&rsquo;t visit her. In vain Mrs. Wotherspoon sent her
      bantams&rsquo; eggs, and guinea fowls&rsquo; eggs, and cuttings from their famous
      yellow rose-tree; in vain old Spoon got a worn-out horse, and invested his
      nether man in white cords and top boots to turn out after the harriers; in
      vain he walked a hound in summer, and pulled down gaps, and lifted gates
      off their hinges in winter&mdash;it all only produced thanks and
      politeness. The Yammertons and they were very good How-do-you-do?
      neighbours, but the true beef-and-mutton test of British friendship was
      wanting. The dinner is the thing that signs and seals the acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they had gone on from summer to summer, and from season to season,
      until hope deferred had not only made old Spoon&rsquo;s heart sick, but had also
      seen the white cords go at the knees, causing him to retire his legs into
      the military-striped cinnamon-coloured tweeds in which he appears in:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <a name="linkimage-0056" id="linkimage-0056"> </a>
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to muffling his legs, he had begun to mutter and talk about
      giving up hunting,&mdash;getting old,&mdash;last season&mdash;and so on,
      which made the Major think he would be losing one of the most personable
      of his field. This made him pause and consider how to avert the
      misfortune. Hunted hares he had sent him in more than regular rotation: he
      had liquored him repeatedly at the door; the ladies had reciprocated the
      eggs and the cuttings, with dahlias, and Sir Harry strawberry runners; and
      there really seemed very little left about the place wherewith to
      propitiate a refractory sportsman. At this critical juncture, a too
      confiding hare was reported by Cicely Bennett, farmer Merry field&rsquo;s
      dairymaid, to have taken up her quarters among some tussuckey brambles at
      the north-east corner of Mr. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s cow pasture&mdash;a most
      unusual, indeed almost unprecedented circumstance, which was communicated
      by Wotherspoon in person to the Major at the next meet of the hounds at
      Girdle Stone Green, and received with unfeigned delight by the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; exclaimed he, wringing the old dandy&rsquo;s hand; &ldquo;you
      don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; repeated he, with enthusiasm, for hares were scarce, and
      the country good; in addition to which the Major knew all the gaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I do</i>,&rdquo; replied Spoon, with a confident air, that as good as said,
      you may take my word for anything connected with hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; rejoined the Major, poking him
      familiarly in the ribs with his whip, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do; we&rsquo;ll
      have a turn at her on Tuesday&mdash;meet at your house, eh? what say you
      to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; responded the delighted Wotherspoon, adding, in the
      excitement of the moment, &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you come to breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast,&rdquo; gasped the Major, feeling he was caught. &ldquo;Dash it, what would
      Mrs. Yammerton say? Breakfast!&rdquo; repeated he, running the matter through
      his mind, the wigging of his wife, the walk of his hound, the chance of
      keeping the old boy to the fore if he went&mdash;go he would. &ldquo;With all my
      heart,&rdquo; replied he, dashing boldly at the oiler; for it&rsquo;s of no use a man
      saying he&rsquo;s engaged to breakfast, and the Major felt that if the worst
      came to the worst, it would only be to eat two, one at home, the other
      with Spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was settled, much to Mr. and Mrs. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s satisfaction, who
      were afterwards further delighted to hear that our friend Billy had
      returned, and would most likely be of the party. And most assiduously they
      applied themselves to provide for this, the great event of their lives.

      great Jack-in-the-green. Ivy is a troublesome thing, for it will either
      not grow at all or it grows far too fast, and Wotherspoon&rsquo;s had fairly
      overrun the little angular red brick, red tiled mansion, and helped it to
      its new name of Ivy Bank Tower. If the ivy flourished, however, it was the
      only thing about the place that did; for Wotherspoon was no farmer, and
      the 75A, 3R. 18P., of which the estate consisted, was a very uninviting
      looking property. Indeed Wotherspoon was an illustration of the truth of
      Sydney Smith&rsquo;s observation that there are three things which every man
      thinks he can do, namely, drive a gig, edit a newspaper, and farm a small
      property, and Spoon bought Cowgate Hill thinking it would &ldquo;go of itself,&rdquo;
       as they say of a horse, and that in addition to the rent he would get the
      farmer&rsquo;s profit as well, which he was told ought to be equal to the rent.
      Though he had the Farmers&rsquo; Almanack, he did not attend much to its
      instructions, for if Mrs. Wotherspoon wanted the Fe-a-ton, as she called
      it, to gad about the country in, John Strong, the plough-boy footman
      &ldquo;loused&rdquo; his team, and arraying himself in a chocolate-coloured coat, with
      a red striped vest and black velveteens, left the other horse standing
      idle for the day. So Spoon sometimes caught the season and sometimes he
      lost it; and the neighbours used to hope that he hadn&rsquo;t to live by his
      land. If he caught the season he called it good management; if he didn&rsquo;t
      he laid the blame upon the weather, just as a gardener takes the credit
      for all the good crops of fruit, and attributes the failures to the
      seasons. Still Spoon was not at all sensible of his deficiencies, and
      subscribed a couple of guineas a year to the Harrowford Agricultural
      Society, in return for which he always had the toast of the healths of the
      tenant farmers assigned to him, which he handled in a very magnificent and
      condescending way, acknowledging the obligations the landowners were under
      to them, and hoping the happy union would long subsist to their mutual
      advantage; indeed, if he could only have got the words out of his mouth as
      fast as he got the drink into it, there is no saying but he might some day
      have filled the presidential chair. Now, however, a greater honour even
      than that awaited him, namely, the honour of entertaining the great Major
      Yammerton to breakfast. To this end John Strong was first set to clean the
      very dirty windows, then to trim the ivy and polish the brass knocker at
      the door, next to dig the border, in which grew the famous yellow rose,
      and finally to hoe and rake the carriage-drive up to the house; while Mrs.
      Wotherspoon, aided by Sally Brown, her maid-of-all-work, looked out the
      best blue and gold china, examined the linen, selected a tongue,
      guillotined the poultry, bespoke the eggs, and arranged the general
      programme of the entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major thought himself very sly, and that he was doing the thing very
      cleverly by nibbling and playing with his breakfast on the appointed
      morning, instead of eating voraciously as usual; but ladies often know a
      good deal more than they pretend to do, and Mrs. Yammerton had seen a card
      from Mrs. Wotherspoon to their neighbour, Mrs. Broadfurrow, of
      Blossomfield Farm, inviting Broadfurrow and her to a &ldquo;<i>déjeuner à la
      fourchette</i>&rdquo; to meet Major Yammerton and see the hounds. However, Mrs.
      Yammerton kept the fact to herself, thinking she would see how her Major
      would manoeuvre the matter, and avoid a general acquaintance with the
      Wotherspoons. So she merely kept putting his usual viands before him, to
      try to tempt him into indulgence; but the Major, knowing the arduous part
      he would have to perform at the Tower, kept rejecting all her insidious
      overtures for eating, pretending he was not altogether right. &ldquo;Almond
      pudding hadn&rsquo;t agreed with him,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Never did&mdash;should have
      known better than take it,&rdquo; and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our dawdling hero rather discontented his host, for instead of applying
      himself sedulously to his breakfast, he did nothing but chatter and talk
      to the young ladies, as if there was no such important performance before
      them as a hare to pursue, or the unrivalled harriers to display. He took
      cup after cup, as though he had lost his reckoning, and also the little
      word &ldquo;no&rdquo; from his vocabulary. At length the Major got him raised from the
      table, by telling him they had two miles farther to go than they really
      had, and making for the stable, they found Solomon and the footman
      whipper-in ready to turn out with the hounds. Up went our sportsmen on to
      their horses, and forth came the hounds wriggling and frolicking with joy.
      The cavalcade being thus formed, they proceeded across the fields, at the
      back of the house, and were presently passing up the Hollington Lane. The
      gift grey was the first object of interest as soon as they got well under
      way, and the Major examined him attentively, with every desire to find
      fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neatish horse,&rdquo; at length observed he, half to himself, half to our
      friend; &ldquo;neatish horse&mdash;lightish of bone below the knee, p&rsquo;raps, but
      still by no means a bad shaped &lsquo;un.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still though the Major could&rsquo;nt hit off the fault, he was pretty sure
      there was a screw loose somewhere, to discover which he now got Billy to
      trot the horse, aud cauter him, and gallop him, successively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted he, as he returned after a brush over the rough ground of
      Farthingfield Moor; &ldquo;he has the use of his legs&mdash;gets well away; easy
      horse under you, I dessay?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy said he was, for he could pull him about anywhere; saying which he
      put him boldly at a water furrow, and landed handsomely on the far side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted the Major again, muttering to himself, &ldquo;May be all right&mdash;but
      if he is, it&rsquo;s devilish unlike the Baronet, giving him. Wish he would take
      that confounded moon-eyed brute of mine and give me my forty puns back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he gave him ye, did he?&rdquo; asked the Major, with a scrutinising stare
      at our friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yarse&mdash;no&mdash;yarse&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; replied Billy,
      hesitating. &ldquo;The fact is, he offered to give me him, and I didn&rsquo;t like
      taking him, and so, after a good deal to do, he said I might give him
      fifty pounds for him, and pay him when it suited me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I twig,&rdquo; replied the Major, adding, &ldquo;then you have to pay fifty pounds
      for him, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or return him,&rdquo; replied Billy, &ldquo;or return him. He made me promise if over
      I wanted to part with him, I would give him the refusal of him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted the Major, looking the horse over attentively. &ldquo;Fifty
      puns,&rdquo; muttered he to himself,&mdash;&ldquo;must be worth that if he&rsquo;s sound,
      and only eight off. Wouldn&rsquo;t mind giving fifty for him myself,&rdquo; thought
      he; &ldquo;must be something wrong about him&mdash;certain of that&mdash;or Sir
      Moses wouldn&rsquo;t have parted with him;&rdquo; with which firm conviction, and the
      full determination to find out the horse&rsquo;s weak point, the Major trotted
      along the Bodenham Road, through the little hamlet of Maywood, thence
      across Faulder the cattle jobber&rsquo;s farm, into the Heath-field Road at
      Gilden Bridge. A quarter of a mile further, and Mr. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s
      residence was full in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Tower&rdquo; never, perhaps, showed to greater advantage than it did on
      this morning, for a bright winter&rsquo;s sun lit up the luxuriant ivy on its
      angular, gable-ended walls, nestling myriads of sparrows that flew out in
      flocks at the approach of each visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo; asked our hero, as, at a jerk of the Major&rsquo;s head,
      Solomon turned off the road through the now propped-open gate of the
      approach to the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is where we meet,&rdquo; replied the Major; &ldquo;this is Mr.
      Wotherspoon&rsquo;s, the gentleman you remember out with us the day we had the
      famous run when we lost the hare at Mossheugh Law&mdash;the farm by the
      moor, you know, where the pretty woman was churning&mdash;you remember,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, ah!&rdquo; repeated Billy: &ldquo;but I thought they called his place a Tower,&mdash;Ivy
      something Tower,&rdquo; thinking this was more like two great sentry boxes
      placed at right angles, and covered with ivy than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes; he calls this a Tower,&rdquo; replied the Major, seeing by Billy&rsquo;s
      face that his friend had not risen in his estimation by the view of his
      mansion. &ldquo;Capital feller Spoon, though,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;must go in and pay
      our respects to him and his lady.&rdquo; So saying, he turned off the road upon
      the closely eaten sward, and, calling to Solomon to stop and let the
      hounds have a roll on the grass, he dismounted, and gave his horse in
      charge of a fustian-clad countryman, telling him to walk him about till he
      returned, and he would remember him for his trouble. Our friend Billy did
      the same, and knocking the mud sparks off his boots against the well
      pipe-clayed door-steps, prepared to enter the Tower. Before inducting
      them, however, let us prepare the inmates for their reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Mr. and Mrs. Wotherspoon had risen sufficiently early to enable them
      to put the finishing stroke to their respective arrangements, and then to
      apparel themselves for the occasion. They were gorgeously attired, vieing
      with the rainbow in the colour of their clothes. Old Spoon, indeed, seemed
      as if he had put all the finery on he could raise, and his best brown
      cauliflower wig shone resplendent with Macassar oil. He had on a light
      brown coat with a rolling velvet collar, velvet facings and cuffs, with a
      magnificent green, blue, and yellow striped tartan velvet vest, enriched
      with red cornelian buttons, and crossed diagonally with a massive
      Brazilian gold chain, and the broad ribbon of his gold double-eye-glasses.
      He sported a light blue satin cravat, an elaborately worked ruby-studded
      shirt front, over a pink flannel vest, with stiff wrist-bands well turned
      up, showing the magnificence of his imitation India garnet buttons. On his
      clumsy fingers he wore a profusion of rings&mdash;a brilliant cluster, a
      gold and opal, a brilliant and sapphire, an emerald half-hoop ring, a
      massive mourning, and a signet ring,&mdash;six in all,&mdash;genuine or
      glass as the case might be, equally distributed between the dirty-nailed
      fingers of each hand. His legs were again encased in the treacherous white
      cords and woe-begone top-boots that were best under the breakfast table.
      He had drawn the thin cords on very carefully, hoping they would have the
      goodness to hang together for the rest of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wotherspoon was bedizened with jewellery and machinery lace. She wore
      a rich violet-coloured velvet dress, with a beautiful machinery lace
      chemisette, fastened down the front with large Cairngorum buttons, the
      whole connected with a diminutive Venetian chain, which contrasted with
      the massive mosaic one that rolled and rattled upon her plump shoulders. A
      splendid imitation emerald and brilliant brooch adorned her bust, while
      her well-rounded arms were encircled with a mosaic gold, garnet and
      turquoise bracelet, an imitation rose diamond one, intermixed with pearl,
      a serpent armlet with blood-stone eyes, a heavy jet one, and an equally
      massive mosaic gold one with a heart&rsquo;s ease padlock. Though in the full
      development of womanhood, she yet distended her figure with crinoline, to
      the great contraction of her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two had scarcely entered the little parlour, some twelve feet square,
      and Spoon got out his beloved Morning Post, ere Mr. and Mrs. Broadfurrow
      were seen wending their way up the road, at the plodding diligent sort of
      pace an agricultural horse goes when put into harness; and forthwith the
      Wotherspoons dismissed the last anxieties of preparation, and lapsed into
      the easy, unconcerned host and hostess. When John Strong threw open the
      door, and announced Mr. and Mrs. Broadfurrow, they were discovered
      standing over the fire, as if <i>d&rsquo;ejeuner à la fourchette</i> giving was
      a matter of every day&rsquo;s occurrence with them. Then, at the summons, they
      turned and came forward in the full glow of cordiality, and welcomed their
      guests with all the fervour of sincerity; and when Mrs. Wotherspoon
      mounted the weather for a trot with Mrs. Broadfurrow, old Spoon out with
      his engine-turned gold snuff-box, and offered Broadfurrow a pinch ere he
      threw his conversation into the columns of his paper. The offer being
      accepted, Wotherspoon replenished his own nose, and then felt ready for
      anything. He was in high feather. He sunk his favourite topic, the doings
      of the House of Lords, and expatiated upon the Princess Royal&rsquo;s then
      approaching marriage. Oh, dear, he was so glad. He was so glad of it&mdash;glad
      of it on every account&mdash;glad of it on the Princess&rsquo;s account&mdash;glad
      of it on her most gracious Majesty&rsquo;s account. Bless her noble heart! it
      almost made him feel like an old man when he remembered the Prince Consort
      leading her to the hymeneal altar herself. Well, well, life was life, and
      he had seen as much of it as most men; and just as he was going to indulge
      in some of his high-flown reminiscences, the crack of a hunting whip
      sounded through the house, and farmer Nettlefold&rsquo;s fat figure, attired in
      the orthodox green coat and white cords of the Major Yammerton&rsquo;s hunt was
      seen piled on a substantial brown cob, making his way to the stables at
      the back of the Tower. Mr. Nettlefold, who profanely entered by the back
      door, was then presently announced, and the same greetings having been
      enacted towards him, Wotherspoon made a bold effort to get back to the
      marriage, beginning with &ldquo;As I was observing,&rdquo; when farmer Rintoul came
      trotting up on his white horse, and holloaed out to know if he could get
      him put up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; replied Wotherspoon, throwing up the window, when a
      sudden gust of wind nearly blew off his wig, and sadly disconcerted the
      ladies by making the chimney smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this moment our friend appeared in sight, and all eyes were then
      directed to the now gamboling tongue-throwing hounds, as they spread
      frisking over the green.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What beauties!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Wotherspoon, pretending to admire them,
      though in reality she was examining the Point de Paris lace on Mrs.
      Broadfurrow&rsquo;s mantle&mdash;wondering what it would be a yard, thinking it
      was very extravagant for a person like her to have it so broad. Old Spoon,
      meanwhile, bustled away to the door, to be ready to greet the great men as
      they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Yammerton and Mr. Jingle!&rdquo; announced John Strong, throwing it open,
      and the old dandy bent nearly double with his bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are ye, Wotherspoon?&rdquo; demanded our affable master, shaking him
      heartily by the hand, with a hail-fellow-well-met air of cordiality. &ldquo;Mr.
      Pringle you know,&rdquo; continued he, drawing our friend forward with his left
      hand, while he advanced with his right to greet the radiant Mrs.
      Wotherspoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Major then went the round of the party, whole handing Mrs.
      Broadfurrow, three fingering her husband, presenting two to old Rintonl,
      and nodding to Nettlefold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a beautiful morning,&rdquo; observed he, now Colossus-of-Rhodesing
      with his clumsily built legs&mdash;&ldquo;most remarkable season this I ever
      remember during the five-and-thirty years that I have kept haryers&mdash;more
      like summer than winter, only the trees are as bare of leaves as
      boot-trees, <i>haw, haw, haw</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He, he, he</i>,&rdquo; chuckled old Wotherspoon, &ldquo;v-a-a-ry good, Major,
      v-a-a-ry good,&rdquo; drawled he, taking a plentiful replenishment of snuff as
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast was then announced, and the Major making up to the inflated Mrs.
      Wotherspoon tendered his arm, and with much difficulty piloted her past
      the table into the little duplicate parlour across the passage, followed
      by Wotherspoon with Mrs. Broadfurrow and the rest of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the fruits of combined science appeared in the elegant arrangement
      of the breakfast-table, the highly polished plate vieing with the snowy
      whiteness of the cloth, and the pyramidical napkins encircling around.
      Then there was the show pattern tea and coffee services, chased in wreaths
      and scrolls, presented to Mr. Wotherspoon by the Duke of Thunderdownshire
      on his marriage; the Louis Quatorze kettle presented to Mrs. Wotherspoon
      by the Duchess, with the vine-leaf-patterned cake-basket, the
      Sutherland-patterned toast-rack, and the tulip-patterned egg-stand, the
      gifts and testimonials of other parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the entertainment devoted to mere show, for piles of cakes and
      bread of every shape and make were scattered profusely about, while a
      couple of covered dishes on the well polished little sideboard denoted
      that the fourchette of the card was not a mere matter of form. Best of
      all, a group of flat vine-leaf encircling Champagne glasses denoted that
      the repast was to be enlivened with the exhilarating beverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party having at length settled into seats, Major Yammerton on Mrs.
      Wotherspoon&rsquo;s right, Mr. Pringle on her left, Mrs. Broadfurrow on Spoon&rsquo;s
      right, her husband on his left, with Rintoul and Nettlefold filling in the
      interstices, breakfast began in right earnest, and Mrs. Wotherspoon having
      declined the Major&rsquo;s offer of assisting with the coffee, now had her hands
      so full distributing the beverages as to allow him to apply himself
      sedulously to his food. This he did most determinedly, visiting first one
      detachment of cakes, then another, and helping himself liberally to both
      hashed woodcocks and kidneys from under the covers. His quick eye having
      detected the Champagne glasses, and knowing Wotherspoon&rsquo;s reputed
      connoisseurship in wines, he declined Mrs. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s tea, reserving
      himself for what was to follow. In truth, Spoon was a good judge of wine,
      so much so that he acted as a sort of decoy duck to a London house, who
      sent him very different samples to the wine they supplied to the customers
      with whom he picked up. He had had a great deal of experience in wines,
      never, in the course of a longish life having missed the chance of a
      glass, good, bad, or indifferent. We have seen many men set up for judges
      without a tithe of Wotherspoon&rsquo;s experience. Look at a Club for instance.
      We see the footman of yesterday transformed into the butler of to-day,
      giving his opinion to some newly joined member on the next, with all the
      authority of a professor&mdash;talking of vintages, and flavours, and
      roughs and smooths, and sweets, and drys, as if he had been drinking wine
      all his life. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s prices were rather beyond the Major&rsquo;s mark,
      but still he had no objection to try his wine, and talk as if he would
      like to have some of the same sort. So having done ample justice to the
      eatables he turned himself back in his chair and proceeded to criticise
      Mrs. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s now slightly flushed face, and wonder how such a pretty
      woman could marry such a snuffy old cock. While this deliberate scrutiny
      was going on, the last of the tea-drinkers died out, and at a pull of the
      bell, John Strong came in, and after removing as many cups and saucers as
      he could clutch, he next proceeded to decorate the table with Champagne
      glasses amid the stares and breath-drawings of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this interesting operation was proceeding, the old dandy host
      produced his snuff-box, and replenishing his nose passed it on to
      Broadfurrow to send up the table, while he threw himself back in his chair
      and made a mental wager that Strong would make a mistake between the
      Champagne and the Sillery. The glasses being duly distributed, and the
      Major&rsquo;s eye at length caught, our host after a prefatory throat-clearing
      hem thus proceeded to address him, individually, for the good of the
      company generally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Yammerton,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will take the liberty of recommending a
      glass of Sillery to you.&mdash;The sparkling, I believe, is very good, but
      the still is what I particularly pride myself upon and recommend to my
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strong!&rdquo; continued he, addressing the clown, &ldquo;the Sillery to Major
      Yammerton,&rdquo; looking at Strong as much as to say, &ldquo;you know it&rsquo;s the bottle
      with the red cord round the neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Major, however, like many of us, was not sufficiently versed in the
      delicacies of Champagne drinking to prefer the Sillery, and to his host&rsquo;s
      dismay called for the sparkling-stuff that Wotherspoon considered was only
      fit for girls at a boarding school. The rest of the party, however, were
      of the Major&rsquo;s opinion, and all glasses were eagerly held for the
      sparkling fluid, while the Sillery remained untouched to the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is but justice to Wotherspoon to add, that he showed himself deserving
      of the opportunity, for he immediately commenced taking two glasses to his
      guest&rsquo;s one.
    </p>
    <p>
      That one having been duly sipped and quaffed and applauded, and a becoming
      interval having elapsed between, Mr. Wotherspoon next rose from his chair,
      and looking especially wise, observed, up the table &ldquo;that there was a
      toast he wished&mdash;he had&mdash;he had&mdash;he wished to propose,
      which he felt certain under any&mdash;any (pause) circumstances, would be
      (pause again) accepted&mdash;he meant received with approbation
      (applause), not only with approbation, but enthusiasm,&rdquo; continued he,
      hitting off the word he at first intended to use, amid renewed applause,
      causing a slight &ldquo;this is my health,&rdquo; droop of the head from the Major&mdash;&ldquo;But
      when,&rdquo; continued the speaker, drawing largely on his snuff-box for
      inspiration, &ldquo;But when in addition to the natural and intrinsic (pause)
      merit of the (hem) illustrious individual&rdquo; (&ldquo;Coming it strong,&rdquo; thought
      the Major, who had never been called illustrious before,) &ldquo;there is
      another and a stronger reason,&rdquo; continued Wotherspoon, looking as if he
      wished he was in his seat again&mdash;&ldquo;a reason that comes &lsquo;ome to the
      &lsquo;earts and symphonies of us all (applause). (&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the hounds,&rdquo;
       thought the Major, &ldquo;only I &lsquo;spose he means sympathies.&rdquo;) &ldquo;I feel (pause)
      assured,&rdquo; continued Mr. Wotherspoon, &ldquo;that the toast will be received with
      the enthusiasm and popularity that ever attends the (pause) mention of
      intrinsic merit, however (pause) &lsquo;umbly and inadequately the (pause) toast
      may be (pause) proposed,&rdquo; (great applause, with cries of no, no,) during
      which the orator again appealed to his snuff-box. He knew he had a good
      deal more to say, but he felt he couldn&rsquo;t get it out. If he had only kept
      his seat he thought he might have managed it. &ldquo;I therefore,&rdquo; said he,
      helping Mrs. Broadfurrow to the sparkling, and passing the bottle to her
      husband while he again appealed to the Sillery, &ldquo;beg to propose, with
      great sincerity, the &lsquo;ealth of Her most gracious Majesty The Queen! The
      Queen! God bless her!&rdquo; exclaimed Wotherspoon, holding up a brimming bumper
      ere he sunk in his chair to enjoy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart!&rdquo; gasped the disgusted Major, writhing with vexation&mdash;observing
      to Mrs. Wotherspoon as he helped her, and then took severe toll of the
      passing bottle himself, &ldquo;by Jove, your husband ought to be in Parliament&mdash;never
      heard a man acquit himself better&rdquo;&mdash;the Major following the now
      receding bottle with his eye, whose fast diminishing contents left little
      hopes of a compliment for himself out of its contents. He therefore felt
      his chance was out, and that he had been unduly sacrificed to Royalty. Not
      so, however, for Mr. Wotherspoon, after again charging his nose with
      snuff, and passing his box round the table while he collected his
      scattered faculties for the charge, now drew the bell-cord again, and
      tapping with his knife against the empty bottle as &ldquo;Strong&rdquo; entered,
      exclaimed, &ldquo;Champagne!&rdquo; with the air of a man accustomed to have all the
      wants of life supplied by anticipation. There&rsquo;s nobody gets half so well
      waited upon as an old servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This order being complied with, and having again got up the steam of his
      eloquence, Mr. Wotherspoon arose, and, looking as wise as before,
      observed, &ldquo;That there was another toast he had to propose, which he felt
      (pause) sure would (pause) would be most agreeable and acceptable to the
      meeting,&mdash;he meant to say the party, the present party (applause)&mdash;under
      any circumstances (sniff, snuff, sneeze); he was sure it would be most
      (snuff) acceptable, for the great and distinguished (pause), he had almost
      said illustrious (sniff), gentleman (pause), was&mdash;was estimable&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is me, at all events,&rdquo; thought the Major, again
      slightly drooping his too bashful head, as though the shower-bath of
      compliment was likely to be too heavy for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;was estimable (pause) and glorious in every relation
      of life (applause), and keeps a pack of hounds second to none in the
      kingdom (great applause, during which the drooping head descended an inch
      or two lower). I need not after that (snuff) expression of your (sniff)
      feelings (pause), undulate on the advantage such a character is of to the
      country, or in promoting (pause) cheerful hospitality in all its (pause)
      branches, and drawing society into sociable communications; therefore I
      think I shall (pause) offer a toast most, most heartily acceptable
      (sniff) to all your (snuff) feelings, when I propose, in a bumper toast,
      the health of our most&mdash;most distinguished and&mdash;and hospitable
      host&mdash;guest, I mean&mdash;Major Yammerton, and his harriers!&rdquo;
      saying which, the old orator filled himself a bumper of Sillery, and sent
      the sparkling beverage foaming and creaming on its tour. He then
      presently led the charge with a loud, &ldquo;Major! your very good
      health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major, your very good health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very good health, Major!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major, your very good health!&rdquo; then followed up as quickly as the glasses
      could be replenished, and the last explosion having taken place, the
      little Major arose, and looked around him like a Bantam cock going to
      crow. He was a man who could make what he would call an off-hand speech,
      provided he was allowed to begin with a particular word, and that word was
      &ldquo;for.&rdquo; Accordingly, he now began with,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, <i>For</i> the very distinguished honour you have
      thus most unexpectedly done me, I beg to return you my most grateful and
      cordial thanks. (Applause.) I beg to assure you, that the &lsquo;steem and
      approbation of my perhaps too partial friends, is to me the most
      gratifying of compliments; and if during the five-and-thirty years I have
      kept haryers, I have contributed in any way to the &lsquo;armony and good
      fellowship of this neighbourhood, it is indeed to me a source of unfeigned
      pleasure. (Applause.) I &lsquo;ope I may long be spared to continue to do so.
      (Renewed applause.) Being upon my legs, ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; continued
      he, &ldquo;and as I see there is still some of this most excellent and
      exhilarating beverage in the bottle (the Major holding up a half-emptied
      one as he spoke), permit me to conclude by proposing as a toast the &lsquo;ealth
      of our inestimable &lsquo;ost and &lsquo;ostess&mdash;a truly exemplary couple, who
      only require to be known to be respected and esteemed as they ought to be.
      (Applause.) I have great pleasure in proposing the &lsquo;ealth of Mr. and Mrs.
      Wotherspoon! (Applause.) Mrs. Wotherspoon,&rdquo; continued he, bowing very low
      to his fair hostess, and looking, as he thought, most insinuating, &ldquo;your
      <i>very</i> good &lsquo;ealth! Wotherspoon!&rdquo; continued he, standing erect, and
      elevating his voice, &ldquo;Your very good &lsquo;ealth!&rdquo; saying which he quaffed off
      his wine, and resumed his seat as the drinking of the toast became
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile old Wotherspoon had taken a back hand at the Sillery, and again
      arose, glass in hand, to dribble out his thanks for the honour the Major
      and company had done Mrs. Wotherspoon and himself, which being the
      shortest speech he had made, was received with the greatest applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      All parties had now about arrived at that comfortable state when the
      inward monitor indicates enough, and the active-minded man turns to the
      consideration of the &ldquo;next article, mem,&rdquo;&mdash;as the teasing
      shop-keepers say, The Major&rsquo;s &ldquo;next article,&rdquo; we need hardly say, was his
      haryers, which were still promenading in front of the ivy-mantled tower,
      before an admiring group of pedestrians and a few sorrily mounted
      horsemen,&mdash;old Duffield, Dick Trail, and one or two others,&mdash;who
      would seem rather to have come to offer up their cattle for the boiler,
      than in expectation of their being able to carry them across country with
      the hounds. These are the sort of people who stamp the farmers&rsquo; hedges
      down, and make hare hunting unpopular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, what say you to turning out?&rdquo; now asked our Master, as
      Wotherspoon still kept working away at the Sillery, and maundering on to
      Mr. Broadfurrow about the Morning Post and high life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, what you think proper,&rdquo; replied Spoon, taking a heavy pinch of
      snuff, and looking at the empty bottles on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hare, you say, is close at hand,&rdquo; observed our master of hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close at hand, close at hand&mdash;at the corner of my field, in fact,&rdquo;
       assented Wotherspoon, as if there was no occasion to be in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s be at her!&rdquo; exclaimed the Major rising with wine-inspired
      confidence, and feeling that it would require a very big fence to stop him
      with the hounds in full cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but we are going to see you, ain&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Wotherspoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; replied our Master; adding, &ldquo;but hadn&rsquo;t you better get
      your bonnet on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Wotherspoon, looking significantly at Mrs.
      Broadfurrow; whereupon the latter rose, and with much squeezing, and
      pardoning, and thank-you-ing, the two succeeded in effecting a retreat.
      The gentlemen then began kicking their legs about, feeling as though they
      would not want any dinner that day.

      CHAPTER LV.<br/>THE COUNCIL OF WAR.&mdash;POOR PUSS AGAIN!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HILE the ladies
      were absent adorning themselves, the gentlemen held a council of war as to
      the most advisable mode of dealing with the hare, aud the best way of
      making her face a good country. The Major thought if they could set her
      a-going with her head towards Martinfield-heath, they would stand a good
      chance of a run; while Broadfurrow feared Borrowdale brook would be in the
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not Linacres?&rdquo; asked Mr. Rintoul, who preferred having the hounds
      over any one&rsquo;s farm but his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Linacres is not a bad line,&rdquo; assented the Major thoughtfully; &ldquo;Linacres
      is not a bad line, &lsquo;specially if she keeps clear of Minsterfield-wood and
      Dowland preserve; but if once she gets to the preserve it&rsquo;s all U. P., for
      we should have as many hares as hounds in five minutes, to say nothing of
      Mr. Grumbleton reading the riot act among us to boot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye how to do, then,&rdquo; interposed fat Mr. Nettlefold, holding his
      coat laps behind him as he protruded his great canary-coloured stomach
      into the ring; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how to do, then. Just crack her away back
      over this way, and see if you can&rsquo;t get her for Witherton and Longworth.
      Don&rsquo;t you mind,&rdquo; continued he, button-holeing the Major, &ldquo;what a hunt we
      had aboot eighteen years since with a har we put off old Tommy Carman&rsquo;s
      stubble, that took us reet away over Marbury Plot, the Oakley hill, and
      then reet down into Woodbury Yale, where we killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do!&rdquo; exclaimed the delighted Major, his keen eyes glistening
      with pleasure at the recollection. &ldquo;The day Sam Snowball rode into
      Gallowfield bog and came out as black as a sweep&mdash;I remember it well.
      Don&rsquo;t think I ever saw a better thing. If it had been a&mdash;a&mdash;certain
      somebody&rsquo;s hounds (<i>he, he, he!</i>), whose name I won&rsquo;t mention (<i>haw,
      haw, haw!</i>), we should never have heard the last of it (<i>he, he, he!</i>).&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While this interesting discussion was going on, old Wotherspoon who had
      been fumbling at the lock of the cellaret, at length got it open, and
      producing therefrom one of those little square fibre-protected bottles,
      with mysterious seals and hieroglyphical labels, the particoloured letters
      leaning different ways, now advanced, gold-dotted liquor-glass in hand,
      towards the group, muttering as he came, &ldquo;Major Yammerton, will you &lsquo;blege
      me with your &lsquo;pinion of this Maraschino di Zara, which my wine merchants
      recommend to me as something very &lsquo;tickler,&rdquo; pouring out a glass as he
      spoke, and presenting it to his distinguished guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; replied the Major, who rather liked a glass of
      liquor; adding, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll all give our opinion, won&rsquo;t we, Pringle?&rdquo; appealing
      to our hero.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much pleasure,&rdquo; replied Billy, who didn&rsquo;t exactly know what it was, but
      still was willing to take it on trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; rejoined old Spoon; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right; then &lsquo;blege me,&rdquo;
       continued he, &ldquo;by helping yourselves to glasses from the sideboard,&rdquo;
       nodding towards a golden dotted brood clustering about a similarly adorned
      glass jug like chickens around a speckled hen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this intimation a move was made to the point; and all being duly
      provided with glasses, the luscious beverage flowed into each in
      succession, producing hearty smacks of the lips, and &ldquo;very goods&rdquo; from
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think so,&rdquo; replied the self-satisfied old dandy; &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo;
       repeated he, replenishing his nose with a good pinch of snuff; &ldquo;Comes from
      Steinberger and Leoville, of King Street, Saint Jeames&rsquo;s&mdash;very old
      &lsquo;quaintance of mine&mdash;great house in the days of George the Fourth of
      festive memory. And, by the way, that reminds me,&rdquo; continued he, after a
      long-drawn respiration, &ldquo;that I have forgotten a toast that I feel (pause)
      we ought to have drunk, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it now then,&rdquo; interrupted the Major, presenting his glass for
      a second helping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; replied &ldquo;Wotherspoon, thus cut short in his oration,
      proceeding to replenish the glasses, but with more moderate quantities
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now what&rsquo;s your toast?&rdquo; demanded the Major, anxious to be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The toast I was about to propose&mdash;or rather, the toast I forgot to
      propose,&rdquo; proceeded the old twaddler, slowly and deliberately, with divers
      intermediate sniffs and snuffs, &ldquo;was a toast that I feel &lsquo;sured will come
      &lsquo;ome to the &lsquo;arts and symphonies of us all, being no less a&mdash;a&mdash;(pause)
      toast than the toast of the illustrious (pause), exalted&mdash;I may say,
      independent&mdash;I mean Prince&mdash;Royal Highness in fact&mdash;who
      (wheeze) is about to enter into the holy state of matrimony with our own
      beloved and exalted Princess (Hear, hear, hear). I therefore beg to
      (pause) propose that we drink the &lsquo;ealth of His Royal (pause) &lsquo;Ighness
      Prince (pause) Frederick (snuff) William (wheeze) Nicholas (sniff)
      Charles!&rdquo; with which correct enunciation the old boy brightened up and
      drank off his glass with the air of a man who has made a clean breast of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink both their &lsquo;ealths!&rdquo; exclaimed the Major, holding up his glass, and
      condensing the toast into &ldquo;The &lsquo;ealths of their Royal Highnesses!&rdquo; it was
      accepted by the company with great applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the last of the glasses was drained, and the lip-smacking guests
      were preparing to restore them to the sideboard, a slight rustle was heard
      at the door, which opening gently, a smart black velvet bonnet trimmed
      with cerise-coloured velvet and leaves, and broad cerise-coloured ribbons,
      piloted Mrs. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s pretty face past the post, who announced that
      Mrs. Broadfurrow and she were ready to go whenever they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be going, then,&rdquo; exclaimed Major Yammerton, hurrying to the
      sideboard and setting down his glass. &ldquo;How shall it be, then? How shall it
      be?&rdquo; appealing to the company. &ldquo;Give them a view or put her away quietly?&mdash;give
      them a view or put her away quietly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, put her away quietly,&rdquo; responded Mr. Broadfurrow, who had seen many
      hares lost by noise and hurry at starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With her &lsquo;ead towards Martinfield?&rdquo; asked the Major.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can manage it,&rdquo; replied Broadfurrow, well knowing that these sort
      of feats are much easier planned than performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Spose we let Mrs. Wotherspoon put her away for us,&rdquo; now suggested Mr.
      Rintonl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means!&rdquo; rejoined the delighted Major; &ldquo;by all means! She knows the
      spot, and will conduct us to it. Mrs. Wotherspoon,&rdquo; continued he, stumping
      up to her as she now stood waiting in the little passage, &ldquo;allow me to
      have the honour of offering you my arm;&rdquo; so saying, the Major presented it
      to her, observing confidentially as they passed on to the now open front
      door, &ldquo;I feel as if we were going to have a clipper!&rdquo; lowering the ominous
      hat-string as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Solomon! Solomon!&rdquo; cried he, to the patient huntsman, who had been
      waiting all this time with the hounds. &ldquo;We are going! we are going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Major,&rdquo; replied Solomon, with a respectful touch of his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; cried the Major, wheeling sharp round with his fair charge,
      and treading on old Wotherspoon&rsquo;s gouty foot, who was following too
      closely behind with Mrs. Broadfurrow on his arm, causing the old cock to
      catch up his leg and spin round on the other, thus splitting the
      treacherous cords across the knee.

    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oh-o-o-o!</i>&rdquo; shrieked he, wrinkling his face up like a Norfolk
      biffin, and hopping about as if he was dancing a hornpipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oh-o-o-o!</i>&rdquo; went he again, on setting it down to try if he could
      stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really beg you ten thousand pardons!&rdquo; now exclaimed the disconcerted
      Major, endeavouring to pacify him. &ldquo;I really beg you ten thousand pardons;
      but I thought you were ever so far behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So did I, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Wotherspoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a gay young chap, and step so smartly, you&rsquo;d tread on any
      body&rsquo;s heels,&rdquo; observed the Major jocularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but it was a pincher, I assure you,&rdquo; observed Wotherspoon, still
      screwing up his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he got his foot down again, and the assault party was reformed,
      the Major and Mrs. Wotherspoon again leading, old Spoon limping along at a
      more respectful distance with Mrs. Broadfurrow, while the gentlemen
      brought up the rear with the general body of pedestrians, who now deserted
      Solomon and the hounds in order to see poor puss started from her form.
      Solomon was to keep out of sight until she was put away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through the little American blighted orchard, and what Spoon
      magnificently called his kitchen garden, consisting of a dozen grass-grown
      gooseberry bushes, and about as many winter cabbages, they came upon a
      partially-ploughed fallow, with a most promising crop of conch grass upon
      the unturned part, the hungry soil looking as if it would hardly return
      the seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine country! fine country!&rdquo; muttered the Major, looking around on the
      sun-bright landscape, and thinking he could master it whichever way the
      hare went. Up Sandywell Lane for Martinfield Moor, past Woodrow Grange for
      Linacres, and through Farmer Fulton&rsquo;s fold-yard for Witherton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, he could do it; and make a very good show out of sight of the
      ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, where have you her? where have you her?&rdquo; whispered he, squeezing
      Mrs. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s plump arm to attract her attention, at the same time
      not to startle the hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, in the next field,&rdquo; whispered she, &ldquo;in the next field,&rdquo; nodding
      towards a drab-coloured pasture in which a couple of lean and dirty cows
      were travelling about in search of a bite. They then proceeded towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gallant Major having opened the ricketty gate that intervened between
      the fallow and it, again adopted his fair charge, and proceeded stealthily
      along the high ground by the ragged hedge on the right, looking back and
      holding up his hand for silence among the followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Mrs. Wotherspoon stopped. &ldquo;There, you see,&rdquo; said she, nodding
      towards a piece of rough, briary ground, on a sunny slope, in the far
      corner of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; gasped the delighted Major; &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; repeated he, &ldquo;just the very
      place for a hare to be in&mdash;wonder there&rsquo;s not one there always. Now,&rdquo;
       continued he, drawing his fair charge a little back, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see if we
      can&rsquo;t circumvent her, and get her to go to the west. Rintoul!&rdquo; continued
      he, putting his hand before his mouth to prevent the sound of what he said
      being wafted to the hare. &ldquo;Rintoul! you&rsquo;ve got a whip&mdash;you go below
      and crack her away over the hill, that&rsquo;s a good feller, and we&rsquo;ll see if
      we can&rsquo;t have something worthy of com-mem-mo-ration&rdquo;&mdash;the Major
      thinking how he would stretch out the run for the newspapers&mdash;eight
      miles in forty minutes, an hour and twenty with only one check&mdash;or
      something of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause thrilled through the field, and caused our friend Billy to feel
      rather uncomfortable, he didn&rsquo;t appreciate the beauties of the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rintoul having now got to his point, and prepared his heavy whip-thong,
      the gallant band advanced, in semicircular order, until they came within a
      few paces of where the briars began. At a signal from the Major they all
      hailed. The excitement was then intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see her!&rdquo; now whispered the Major into Mrs. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;I see
      her!&rdquo; repeated he, squeezing her arm, and pointing inwardly with his
      thong-gathered whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s wandering eyes showed that she did not participate in
      the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the tuft of fern just below the thick red-berried rose bush
      a little to the left here?&rdquo; asked the Major; &ldquo;where the rushes die out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wotherspoon nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, she&rsquo;s just under the broken piece of fern that lies bending
      this way. You can see her ears moving at this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wotherspoon&rsquo;s eyes brightened as she saw a twinkling something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now then, put her away!</i>&rdquo; said the Major gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t bite, will she?&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Wotherspoon, pretending alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bite, no!&rdquo; laughed the Major; &ldquo;hares don&rsquo;t bite&mdash;not pretty
      women at least,&rdquo; whispered he. &ldquo;Here take my whip and give her a touch
      behind,&rdquo; handing it to her as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wotherspoon having then gathered up her violet-coloured velvet dress
      a little, in order as well to escape the frays of the sharp-toothed
      brambles as to show her gay red and black striped petticoat below, now
      advanced cautiously into the rough sea, stepping carefully over this
      tussuck and t&rsquo;other, avoiding this briar and that, until she came within
      whip reach of the fern. She then paused, and looked back with the eyes of
      England upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Up with her!&rdquo;</i> cried the excitcd Major, as anxious for a view as if
      he had never seen a hare in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wotherspoon then advanced half a step farther, and protruding the
      Major&rsquo;s whip among the rustling fern, out sprang&mdash;what does the
      reader think?&mdash;A GREAT TOM CAT!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tallyho!</i>&rdquo; cried Billy Pringle, deceived by the colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hoop, hoop, hoop!</i>&rdquo; went old Spoon, taking for granted it was a
      hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Crack!</i> resounded Rintoul&rsquo;s whip from afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Haw, haw, haw!</i> never saw anything like that!&rdquo; roared the Major,
      holding his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a cat!&rdquo; exclaimed the now enlightened Mrs. Wotherspoon, opening
      wide her pretty eyes as she retraced her steps towards where he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cat, ay, to be sure, my dear! why, it&rsquo;s your own, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; demanded our
      gallant Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; ours is a grey&mdash;that&rsquo;s a tabby,&rdquo; replied she, returning him his
      whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grey or tab, it&rsquo;s a cat,&rdquo; replied the Major, eyeing puss climbing up a
      much-lopped ash-tree in the next hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Spoon, old boy, don&rsquo;t you know a cat when you see her?&rdquo; demanded he,
      as his chagrined host now came pottering towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was a hare, &lsquo;pon honour, as we say in the Lords,&rdquo; replied
      the old buck, bowing and consoling himself with a copious pinch of snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a sell,&rdquo; said the Major, thinking what a day he had lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-a-a-vilish likely place for a hare,&rdquo; continued old Wotherspoon,
      reconnoitring it through his double eye-glasses; &ldquo;D-a-a-vilish likely
      place, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, likely enough,&rdquo; muttered the Major, with a chuck of his chin, &ldquo;likely
      enough,&mdash;only it isn&rsquo;t one, <i>that&rsquo;s all!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wish it had been,&rdquo; replied the old boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; simpered his handsome wife, drawing her fine lace-fringed
      kerchief across her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expectations of the day being thus disappointed, another council of
      war was now held, as to the best way of retrieving the misfortune.
      Wotherspoon, who was another instance of the truth of the observation,
      that a man who is never exactly sober is never quite drunk, was inclined
      to get back to the bottle. &ldquo;Better get back to the house,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
      talk matters quietly over before the fire;&rdquo; adding, with a full
      replenishment of snuff up his nose, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a batch of uncommonly fine
      Geisenheimer that I would like your &lsquo;pinion of, Major,&rdquo; but the Major, who
      had had wine enough, and wanted to work it off with a run, refused to
      listen to the tempter, intimating, in a whisper to Mrs. Spoon, who again
      hung on his arm, that her husband would be much better of a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Wotherspoon, thinking from the haziness of the old gentleman&rsquo;s
      voice, and the sapient twinkling of his gooseberry eyes, that he had had
      quite enough wine, seconded this view of the matter; whereupon, after much
      backing and bowing, and shaking of hands, and showing of teeth, the ladies
      and gentlemen parted, the former to the fire, the latter to the field,
      where the performance of the pack must stand adjourned for another
      chapter.

    <p>
      HE worst of these <i>dejeuners à la fourchette</i>, and also of luncheons,
      is, that they waste the day, and then send men out half-wild to ride over
      the hounds or whatever else comes in their way. The greatest funkers, too,
      are oftentimes the boldest under the influence of false courage; so that
      the chances of mischief are considerably increased. The mounted Champagne
      bottle smoking a cigar, at page 71, is a good illustration of what we
      mean. We doubt not Mr. Longneck was very forward in that run.
    </p>
    <p>
      All our Ivy Tower party were more or less primed, and even old Wotherspoon
      felt as if he could ride. Billy, too, mounted the gallant grey without his
      usual nervous misgivings, and trotted along between the Major and Rintoul
      with an easy Hyde Park-ish sort of air. Rintonl had intimated that he
      thought they would find a hare on Mr. Merryweather&rsquo;s farm at Swayland, and
      now led them there by the fields, involving two or three little obstacles&mdash;a
      wattled hurdle among the rest&mdash;which they all charged like men of
      resolution. The hurdle wasn&rsquo;t knocked over till the dogs&rsquo;-meatmen came to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Swayland, the field quickly dispersed, each on his own separate
      hare-seeking speculation, one man fancying a fallow, another a pasture:
      Rintonl reserving the high hedge near the Mill bridle-road, out of which
      he had seen more than one whipped in his time. So they scattered
      themselves over the country, flipping and flopping all the tufts ard
      likely places, aided by the foot-people with their sticks, and their
      pitchings and tossings of stones into bushes and hollows, and other
      tempting-looking retreats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hounds, too, ranged far and wide, examining critically each likely
      haunt, pondering on spots where they thought she had been, but which would
      not exactly justify a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were all thus busily employed, Rintoul&rsquo;s shallow hat in the air
      intimated that the longed-for object was discerned, causing each man to
      get his horse by the head, and the foot-people to scramble towards him,
      looking anxiously forward and hurriedly back, lest any of the riders
      should be over them. Rintoul had put her away, and she was now travelling
      and stopping, and travelling and stopping, listening and wondering what
      was the matter. She had been coursed before but never hunted, and this
      seemed a different sort of proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terror-striking notes of the hounds, as they pounced upon her empty
      form, with the twang of the horn and the cheers of the sportsmen urging
      them on, now caused her to start; and, laying back her long ears, she
      scuttled away over Bradfield Green and up Ridge Hill as hard as ever she
      could lay legs to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, Mr. Pringle! come along, Mr. Pringle!&rdquo; cried the excited
      Major, spurring up, adjusting his whip as if he was going to charge into a
      solid square of infantry. He then popped through an open gate on the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bustling beauties of hounds had now fallen into their established
      order of precedence, Lovely and Lilter contending for the lead, with
      Bustler and Bracelet, and Ruffler and Chaunter, and Ruin and Restless, and
      Dauntless and Driver, and Dancer and Flaunter and others striving after,
      some giving tongue because they felt the scent, others, because the
      foremost gave it.&mdash;So they went truthfully up the green and over the
      hill, a gap, a gate, and a lane serving the bustling horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vale below was not quite so inviting to our &ldquo;green linnets&rdquo; as the
      country they had come from, the fields being small, with the fences as
      irregular as the counties appear on a map of England. There was none of
      that orderly squaring up and uniformity of size, that enables a roadster
      to trace the line of communication by gates through the country.&mdash;All
      was zigzag and rough, indicating plenty of blackthorns and briers to tear
      out their eyes. However, the Champagne was sufficiently alive in our
      sportsmen to prevent any unbecoming expression of fear, though there was a
      general looking about to see who was best acquainted with the country.
      Rintoul was now out of his district, and it required a man well up in the
      line to work them satisfactorily, that is to say, to keep them in their
      saddles, neither shooting them over their horses&rsquo; heads nor swishing them
      over their tails. Our friend Billy worked away on the grey, thinking, if
      anything, he liked him better than the bay. He even ventured to spur him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merry pack now swing musically down the steep hill, the chorus
      increasing as they reach the greener regions below. The fatties, and
      funkers, and ticklish forelegged ones, begin who-a-ing and g-e-e-ntly-ing
      to their screws, holding on by the pommels and cantrells, and keeping
      their nags&rsquo; heads as straight as they can. Old Wotherspoon alone gets off
      and leads down. He&rsquo;s afraid of his horse slipping upon its haunches. The
      sight of him doing so emboldens our Billy, who goes resolutely on, and
      incautiously dropping his hand too soon, the grey shot away with an
      impetus that caused him to cannon off Broadfurrow and the Major and pocket
      himself in the ditch at the bottom of the hill. Great was the uproar! The
      Richest Commoner in England was in danger! Ten thousand a-year in
      jeopardy! &ldquo;Throw yourself off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get clear of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep hold of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind he doesn&rsquo;t strike ye!&rdquo; resounded from all parts, as first the
      horse&rsquo;s head went up, and then his tail, and then his head again, in his
      efforts to extricate himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Billy, seizing a favourable opportunity, threw himself off on
      the green sward, and, ere he could rise, the horse, making a desperate
      plunge, got out, and went staring away with his head in the air, looking
      first to the right and then to the left, as the dangling reins kept
      checking and catching him.

    </h4>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look sharp or you&rsquo;ll loss him!&rdquo; now cried old Duffield, as after an
      ineffectual snatch of the reins by a passing countryman, the horse ducked
      his head and went kicking and wriggling and frolicking away to the left,
      regardless of the tempting cry of the hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pace, of course, was too good for assistance&mdash;and our friend and
      the field were presently far asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever sport the hounds had&mdash;and of course they would have a
      clipper&mdash;we can answer for it Mr. Pringle had a capital run; for his
      horse led him a pretty Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp sort of dance, tempting him on and
      on by stopping to eat whenever his rider&mdash;or late rider, rather&mdash;seemed
      inclined to give up the chase, thus deluding him from field to lane and
      from lane to field until our hero was fairly exhausted.&mdash;Many were
      the rushes and dashes and ventures made at him by hedgers and ditchers and
      drainers, but he evaded them all by laying back his ears and turning the
      battery of his heels for the contemplation, as if to give them the choice
      of a bite or a kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he turned up the depths of the well-known Love Lane, with its
      paved <i>trottoir</i>, for the damsels of the adjoining hamlets of East
      and West Woodhay to come dry-shod to the gossip-shop of the well; and
      here, dressed in the almost-forgotten blue boddice and red petticoat of
      former days, stood pretty Nancy Bell, talking matrimonially to Giles
      Bacon, who had brought his team to a stand-still on the higher ground of
      the adjoining hedge, on the field above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the clatter of hoofs, as the grey tried first the hard and then
      the soft of the lane, Bacon looked that way; and seeing a loose horse he
      jumped bodily into the lane, extending his arms and his legs and his eyes
      and his mouth in a way that was very well calculated to stop even a bolder
      animal than a horse. He became a perfect barrier. The grey drew up with an
      indignant snort and a stamp of his foot, and turning short round he
      trotted back, encountering in due time his agitated and indignant master,
      who had long been vowing what a trimming he would give him when he caught
      him. Seeing Billy in a hurry,&mdash;for animals are very good judges of
      mischief, as witness an old cock how he ducks when one picks up a stone,&mdash;seeing
      Billy in a hurry we say, the horse again wheeled about, and returned with
      more leisurely steps towards his first opponent. Bacon and Nancy were now
      standing together in the lane; and being more pleasantly occupied than
      thinking about loose horses, they just stood quietly and let him come
      towards them, when Giles&rsquo;s soothing w-ho-o-ays and matter-of-course style
      beguiled the horse into being caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy presently came shuffling up, perspiring profusely, with his feet
      encumbered with mud, and stamping the thick of it off while he answered
      Bacon&rsquo;s question as to &ldquo;hoo it happened,&rdquo; and so on, in the grumpy sort of
      way a man does who has lost his horse, he presented him with a shilling,
      and remounting, rode off, after a very fine run of at least twenty
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing our friend did when he got out of sight of Giles Bacon and
      Nancy, was to give his horse a good rap over the head with his whip for
      its impudent stupidity in running away, causing him to duck his head and
      shake it, as if he had got a pea or a flea in his ear.&mdash;He then
      began wheeling round and round, like a dog wanting to lie down, much to
      Billy&rsquo;s alarm, for he didn&rsquo;t wish for any more nonsense. That performance
      over, he again began ducking and shaking his head, and then went moodily
      on, as if indifferent to consequences. Billy wished he mightn&rsquo;t have hit
      him so hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got home, he mentioned the horse&rsquo;s extraordinary proceedings to
      the Major, who, being a bit of a vet. and a strong suspector of Sir
      Moses&rsquo; generosity to boot, immediately set it down to the right cause&mdash;megrims&mdash;and
      advised Billy to return him forthwith, intimating that Sir Moses was not
      altogether the thing in the matter of horses; but our friend, who kept the
      blow with the whip to himself, thought he had better wait a day or two and
      see if the attack would go off.&mdash;In this view he was upheld by Jack
      Rogers, who thought his old recipe, &ldquo;leetle drop gin,&rdquo; would set him all
      right, and proceeded to administer it to himself accordingly. And the
      horse improved so much that he soon seemed himself again, whereupon Billy,
      recollecting Sir Moses&rsquo;s strenuous injunctions to give him the refusal of
      him if ever he wanted to part with him, now addressed him the following
      letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yammerton Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Sir Moses,
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;As I find I must return to town immediately after the hunt ball, to
      which you were so good as invite me, and as the horse you were so good as
      give me would be of no use to me there, I write, in compliance with my
      promise to offer him back to you if ever I wanted to part with him, to say
      that he will be quite at your service after our next day&rsquo;s hunting, or
      before if you like, as I dare say the Major will mount me if I require it.
      He is a very nice horse, and I feel extremely obliged for your very
      handsome intentions with regard to him, which, under other circumstances,
      I should have been glad to accept. Circumstanced as I am, however, he
      would be wasted upon me, and will be much better back in your stud. </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, therefore, send him over on hearing from you; and you can either
      put my I.O.U. in the fire, or enclose it to me by the Post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again thanking you for your very generous offer, and hoping you are
      having good sport, I beg to subscribe myself,
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Pangburn Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And having sealed it with the great seal of state, he handed it to Rougier
      to give to the postman, without telling his host what he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next post brought the following answer:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Many, very many thanks to you, my dear Pringle, for your kind
      recollection of me with regard to the grey, which I assure you stamps you
      in my opinion as a most accurate and excellent young man.&mdash;You are
      quite right in your estimate of my opinion of the horse; indeed, if I had
      not considered him something very far out of the common way, I should not
      have put him into your hands; but knowing him to be as good as he&rsquo;s
      handsome, I had very great satisfaction in placing him with you, as well
      on your own account as from your being the nephew of my old and excellent
      friend and brother baronet, Sir Jonathan Pringle&mdash;to whom I beg you
      to make my best regards when you write.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Even were it not so, however, I should be precluded from accepting your
      kind and considerate offer for only yesterday I sent Wetun into
      Doubleimupshire, to bring home a horse I&rsquo;ve bought of Tom Toweler, on Paul
      Straddler&rsquo;s recommendation, being, as I tell Paul, the last I&rsquo;ll ever buy
      on his judgment, unless he turns out a trump, as he has let me in for some
      very bad ones.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;But, my dear Pringle, ain&rsquo;t you doing yourself a positive injustice in
      saying that you would have no use for the grey in town? Town, my dear
      fellow, is the very place for a horse of that colour, figure, and
      pretension; and a very few turns in the Park, with you on his back, before
      that best of all pennyworths, the chair-sitting swells, might land you in
      the highest ranks of the aristocracy&mdash;unless, indeed, you are booked
      elsewhere, of which, perhaps, I have no business to inquire.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;I may, however, as a general hint, observe to the nephew of my old
      friend, that the Hit-im and Hold-imshire Mammas don&rsquo;t stand any nonsense,
      so you will do well to be on your guard. No; take my advice, my dear
      fellow, and ride that horse in town.&mdash;It will only be sending him to
      Tat.&lsquo;s if you tire of him there, and if it will in any way conduce to your
      peace of mind, and get rid of any high-minded feeling of obligation, you
      can hand me over whatever you get for him beyond the £50 &mdash;And that
      reminds me, as life is uncertain, and it is well to do everything
      regularly, I&rsquo;ll send my agent, Mr. Mordecai Nathan, over with your I.O.U.,
      and you can give me a bill at your own date&mdash;say two or three months&mdash;instead,
      and that will make us all right and square, and, I hope, help to maintain
      the truth of the old adage, that short reckonings make long friends,&mdash;which
      I assure you is a very excellent one.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;And now, having exhausted both my paper and subject, I shall conclude
      with repeating my due appreciation of your kind recollection of my wishes;
      and with best remembrances to your host and hostess, not forgetting their
      beautiful daughters, whom I hope to see in full feather at the ball, I
      remain,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;My dear Pringle.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Very truly and sincerely, yours,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Moses Mainchance.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;To Wm. Pringle&rdquo;</i>
     </p>
    <p>
      We need scarcely add that Mr. Mordecai Nathan followed quickly on the
      heels of the letter, and that the I. 0. U. became a short-winded bill of
      exchange, thus saddling our friend permanently with the gallant grey. And
      when Major Yammerton heard the result, all the consolation Billy got from
      him was, &ldquo;<i>I told you so</i>,&rdquo; meaning that he ought to have taken his
      advice, and returned the horse as unsound.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this episode about the horse, let us return to Pangburn Park.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVII.<br/>THE ANTHONY THOM TRAP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>IR Moses was so
      fussy about his clothes, sending to the laundry for this shirt and that,
      censuring the fold of this cravat and that, inquiring after his new
      hunting ties and best boots, that Mrs. Margerum began to fear the buxom
      widow, Mrs. Vivian, was going to be at Lord Repartee&rsquo;s, and that she might
      be saddled with that direst of all dread inflictions to an honest
      conscientious housekeeper, a teasing, worreting, meddling mistress. That
      is a calamity which will be best appreciated by the sisterhood, and those
      who watch how anxiously &ldquo;widowers and single gentlemen&rdquo; places are
      advertised for in the newspapers, by parties who frequently, not perhaps
      unaptly, describe themselves as &ldquo;thoroughly understanding their business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses, indeed, carried out the deception well; for not only in the
      matter of linen, but in that of clothes also, was he equally particular,
      insisting upon having all his first-class daylight things brought out from
      their winter quarters, and reviewing them himself as they lay on the sofa,
      ere he suffered Mr. Bankhead to pack them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they were sorted and passed into the capacious depths of an
      ample brown leather portmanteau, and the key being duly turned and
      transferred to the Baronet, the package itself was chucked into the
      dog-cart in the unceremonious sort of way luggage is always chucked about.
      The vehicle itself then came to the door, and Sir Moses having delivered
      his last injunctions about the hounds and the horses, and the line of
      coming to cover so as to avoid public-houses, he ascended and touching the
      mare gently with the whip, trotted away amid the hearty&mdash;&ldquo;well shut
      of yous&rdquo; of the household. Each then retired to his or her private
      pursuits; some to drink, some to gamble, some to write letters, Mrs.
      Margerum, of course, to pick up the perquisites. Sir Moses, meanwhile,
      bowled away ostentatiously through the lodges, stopping to talk to
      everybody he met, and saying he was going away for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonmot Park, the seat of Lord Repartee, stands about the junction of
      Hit-im and Hold-imshire, with Featherbedfordshire. Indeed, his great cover
      of Tewington Wood is neutral between the hunts, and the best way to the
      park on wheels, especially in winter time, is through Hinton and Westleak,
      which was the cause of Sir Moses hitting upon it for his deception,
      inasmuch as he could drive into the Fox and Hounds Hotel; and at Hinton,
      under pretence of baiting his mare without exciting suspicion, and there
      make his arrangements for the night. Accordingly, he took it very quietly
      after he got clear of his own premises, coveting rather the shades of
      evening that he had suffered so much from before, and as luck would have
      it by driving up Skinner Lane, instead of through Nelson Street, he caught
      a back view of Paul Straddler, as for the twenty-third time that worthy
      peeped through the panes of Mrs. Winship, the straw-bonnet maker&rsquo;s window
      in the market-place, at a pretty young girl she had just got from
      Stownewton. Seeing his dread acquaintance under such favourable
      circumstances, Sir Moses whipped Whimpering Kate on, and nearly upset
      himself against the kerb-stone as he hurried up the archway of the huge
      deserted house,&mdash;the mare&rsquo;s ringing hoofs alone, announcing his
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Ostler! Ostler! Ostler!</i> cried he in every variety of tone, and at
      length the crooked-legged individual filling that and other offices, came
      hobbling and scratching his head to the summons. Sir Moses alighting then,
      gave him the reins and whip; and wrapper in hand, proceeded to the
      partially gas-lit door in the archway, to provide for himself while the
      ostler looked after the mare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it so happened, that what with bottle ends and whole bottles, and the
      occasional contributions of the generous, our friend Peter the waiter was
      even more inebriated than he appears at page 263; and the rumbling of
      gig-wheels up the yard only made him waddle into the travellers&rsquo; room, to
      stir the fire and twist up a bit of paper to light the gas, in case it was
      any of the despised brotherhood of the road.&mdash;He thought very little
      of bagmen&mdash;Mr. Customer was the man for his money. Now, he rather
      expected Mr. Silesia, Messrs. Buckram the clothiers&rsquo; representative, if
      not Mr. Jaconette, the draper&rsquo;s also, about this time; and meeting Sir
      Moses hurrying in top-coated and cravated with the usual accompaniments of
      the road, he concluded it was one of them; so capped him on to the
      commercial room with his dirty duster-holding hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me a private room, Peter; get me a private room,&rdquo; demanded the
      Baronet, making for the bottom of the staircase away from the indicated
      line of scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private room,&rdquo; muttered Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! me!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Moses, thinking Peter would recognise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but whether are ye a tailor or a draper?&rdquo; demanded Peter, not
      feeling inclined to give way to the exclusiveness of either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tailor or draper! you stupid old sinner&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s me&mdash;me
      Sir Moses Mainchance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sir Moses, Sir, I beg your pardon, Sir,&rdquo; stammered the now
      apologising Peter, hurrying back towards the staircase. &ldquo;I really begs
      your pardon, Sir; but my eyes are beginning to fail me, Sir&mdash;not so
      good as they were when Mr. Customer hunted the country.&mdash;Well Sir
      Moses, Sir, I hope you&rsquo;re well, Sir; and whether will you be in the Sun or
      the Moon? You can have a fire lighted in either in a minute, only you see
      we don&rsquo;t keep fires constant no ways now, &lsquo;cept in the commercial room.&mdash;Great
      change, Sir Moses, Sir, since Mr. Customer hunted the country; yes, Sir,
      great change&mdash;used to have fires in every room, Sir, and brandy and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; interrupted Sir Moses, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit freezing up stairs till
      the fire&rsquo;s burnt up.&mdash;You go and get it lighted, and come to me in
      the commercial-room and tell me when it&rsquo;s ready; and here!&rdquo; continued he,
      &ldquo;I want some dinner in an hour&rsquo;s time, or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means, Sir Moses. What would you like to take, Sir Moses?&rdquo; as if
      there was everything at command.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Have you any soup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Peter</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Soup, Sir Moses. No, I don&rsquo;t think there is any soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Fish; have you any fish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Peter</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Why, no; I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be any fish to-day,
      Sir Moses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>&mdash;&ldquo;What have you, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Peter</i>&mdash;(Twisting the dirty duster), &ldquo;Mutton chops&mdash;beef
      steak&mdash;beef steak&mdash;mutton chops&mdash;boiled fowl, p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;d
      like to take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Sir Moses</i>&mdash;&ldquo;No. I shouldn&rsquo;t (<i>muttering</i>, most likely got
      to be caught and killed yet.) Tell the cook,&rdquo; continued he, speaking up,
      &ldquo;to make on a wood and coal fire, and to do me a nice dish of mutton chops
      on the gridiron; not in the frying-pan mind, all swimming in grease; and
      to boil some mealy potatoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Peter</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, Sir Moses; and what would you like to have to
      follow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Cheese!</i>&rdquo; said Sir Moses, thinking to cut short the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hark&rsquo;e.&rdquo; continued Sir Moses: Don&rsquo;t make a great man of me by
      bringing out your old battered copper showing-dishes; but tell the cook to
      send the chops up hot and hot, between good warm crockery-ware plates,
      with ketchup or Harvey sauce for me to use as I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Sir Moses,&rdquo; replied Peter, toddling off to deliver as much of the
      order as he could remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sir Moses having thawed himself at the commercial-room fire, next
      visited the stable to see that his mare had been made comfortable, and
      told the ostler post-boy boots to be in the way, as he should most likely
      want him to take him out in the fly towards night. As he returned, he met
      Bessey Bannister, the pretty chambermaid, now in the full glow of glossy
      hair and crinoline, whom he enlisted as purveyor of the mutton into the
      Moon, in lieu of the antiquated Peter, whose services he was too glad to
      dispense with.&mdash;It certainly is a considerable aggravation of the
      miseries of a country inn to have to undergo the familiarities of a dirty
      privileged old waiter.

    <p>
      So thought Sir Moses, as he enjoyed each succeeding chop, and complimented
      the fair maiden so on her agility and general appearance, that she
      actually dreamt she was about to become Lady Mainchance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LVIII.<br/>THE ANTHONY THOM TAKE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>IR Moses
      Mainchance, having fortified himself against the night air with a pint of
      club port, and a glass of pale brandy after his tea, at length ordered out
      the inn fly, without naming its destination to his fair messenger. These
      vehicles, now so generally scattered throughout the country, are a great
      improvement on the old yellow post-chaise, that made such a hole in a
      sovereign, and such a fuss in getting ready, holloaing, &ldquo;Fust pair out!&rdquo;
       and so on, to give notice to a smock-frocked old man to transform himself
      into a scarlet or blue jacketed post-boy by pulling off his blouse, and
      who, after getting a leg-up and a ticket for the first turnpike-gate, came
      jingling, and clattering, and cracking his dog-whip round to the inn door,
      attracting all the idlers and children to the spot, to see who was going
      to get into the &ldquo;chay.&rdquo; The fly rumbles quietly round without noise or
      pretension, exciting no curiosity in any one&rsquo;s mind; for it is as often
      out as in, and may only be going to the next street, or to Woodbine Lodge,
      or Balsam Bower, on the outskirts of the town, or for an hour&rsquo;s airing
      along the Featherbedfordshire or the old London road. It does not even
      admit of a pull of the hair as a hint to remember the ostler as he stands
      staring in at the window, the consequence of which is, that the driver is
      generally left to open the door for his passenger himself. Confound those
      old iniquities of travelling!&mdash;a man used never to have his hand out
      of his pocket. Let not the rising generation resuscitate the evil, by
      contravening the salutary regulation of not paying people on railways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses hearing the sound of wheels, put on his wraps; and, rug in hand,
      proceeded quietly down stairs, accompanied only by the fair Bessy
      Bannister, instead of a flight of dirty waiters, holloaing &ldquo;Coming down!
      coming down! now then! look sharp!&rdquo; and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was dark, but the ample cab-lamps threw a gleam over the drab
      and red lined door that George Beer the driver held back in his hand to
      let his customer in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, my dear,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, now slyly squeezing Miss
      Bannister&rsquo;s hand, wondering why people hadn&rsquo;t nice clean quiet-stepping
      women to wait upon them, instead of stuck-up men, who thought to teach
      their masters what was right, who wouldn&rsquo;t let them have their
      plate-warmers in the room, or arrange their tables according to their own
      desires.&mdash;With these and similar reflections he then dived
      head-foremost into the yawning abyss of a vehicle. &ldquo;Bang&rdquo; went the door,
      and Beer then touched the side of his hat for instructions where to go to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, adjusting his rug, as if he hadn&rsquo;t quite
      made up his mind. &ldquo;Let me see&mdash;oh, ah! drive me northwards, and I&rsquo;ll
      tell you further when we stop at the Slopewell turnpike-gate:&rdquo; so saying
      Sir Moses drew up the gingling window, Beer mounted the box, and away the
      old perpetual-motion horse went nodding and knuckling over the uneven
      cobble-stone pavement, varying the motion with an occasional bump and jump
      at the open channels of the streets. Presently a smooth glide announced
      the commencement of Macadam, and shortly after the last gas-lamp left the
      road to darkness and to them. All was starlight and serene, save where a
      strip of newly laid gravel grated against the wheels, or the driver
      objurgated a refractory carter for not getting out of his way. Thus they
      proceeded at a good, steady, plodding sort of pace, never relaxing into a
      walk, but never making any very vehement trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Slopewell gate Sir Moses told Beer to take a ticket for the
      Winterton Burn one; arrived at which, he said, &ldquo;Now go on and stop at the
      stile leading into the plantation, about half a mile on this side of my
      lodges,&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk across the park from there;&rdquo; in obedience to
      which the driver again plied his whip along the old horse&rsquo;s ribs, and in
      due time the vehicle drew up at the footpath along-side the plantation.&mdash;The
      door then opened, Sir Moses alighted and stood waiting while the man
      turned his fly round and drove off, in order to establish his night eyes
      ere he attempted the somewhat intricate passage through the plantation to
      his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night, though dark, was a good deal lighter than it appeared among the
      gloom of the houses and the glare of the gaslights at Hinton; and if he
      was only well through the plantation, Sir Moses thought he should not have
      much difficulty with the rest of the way. So conning the matter over in
      his mind, thinking whereabouts the boards over the ditch were, where the
      big oak stood near which the path led to the left, he got over the stile,
      and dived boldly into the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baronet made a successful progress, and emerged upon the open space of
      Coldnose, just as the night breeze spread the twelve o&rsquo;clock notes of his
      stable clock through the frosty air, upon the quiet country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he to himself, sounding his repeater to ascertain the
      hour, as he followed the tortuous track of the footpath, through cowslip
      pasture, over the fallow and along the side of the turnip field; he then
      came to the turn from whence in daylight the first view of the house is
      obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint light glimmered in the distance, about where he thought the house
      would be situate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do believe that&rsquo;s her room,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, stopping and looking at the
      light. &ldquo;Do believe that&rsquo;s her signal for beloved Anthony Thom. If I catch
      the young scoundrel,&rdquo; continued he, hurrying on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      break every bone in his skin.&rdquo; With this determination, Sir Moses put on
      as fast as the now darker lower ground would allow, due regard being had
      to not missing his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he came to the cattle hurdles that separated the east side of
      the park from the house, climbing over which he was presently among the
      dark yews and hollies, and box-bushes of the shrubbery. He then paused to
      reconnoitre.&mdash;The light was still there.&mdash;If it wasn&rsquo;t Mrs.
      Margerum&rsquo;s room, it was very near it; but he thought it was hers by the
      angle of the building and the chimneys at the end. What should he do?&mdash;Throw
      a pebble at the window and try to get her to lower what she had, or wait
      and see if he could take Anthony Thom, cargo and all? The night was cold,
      but not sufficiently so, he thought, to stop the young gentleman from
      coming, especially if he had his red worsted comforter on; and as Sir
      Moses threw his rug over his own shoulders, he thought he would go for the
      great haul, at all events; especially as he felt he could not converse
      with Mrs. Margerum à la Anthony Thom, should she desire to have a little
      interchange of sentiment. With this determination he gathered his rug
      around him, and proceeded to pace a piece of open ground among the
      evergreens, like the Captain of a ship walking the quarter-deck, thinking
      now of his money, now of his horses, now of Miss Bannister, and now of the
      next week&rsquo;s meets of his hounds.&mdash;He had not got half through his
      current of ideas when a footstep sounded upon the gravel-walk; and,
      pausing in his career, Sir Moses distinctly recognised the light patter of
      some one coming towards him. He down to charge like a pointer to his game,
      and as the sound ceased before the light-showing window, Sir Moses crept
      stealthily round among the bushes, and hid behind a thick ground-sweeping
      yew, just as a rattle of peas broke upon the panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sash then rose gently, and Sir Moses participated in the following
      conversation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum</i> (from above)&mdash;&ldquo;O, my own dearly beloved Anthony
      Thom, is that you, darling! But don&rsquo;t, dear, throw such big &lsquo;andfulls, or
      you&rsquo;ll be bricking the winder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Master Anthony Thom</i> (from below)&mdash;&ldquo;No, mother; only I thought
      you might be asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Sleep, darling, and you coming! I never sleep
      when my own dear Anthony Thom is coming! Bless your noble heart! I&rsquo;ve been
      watching for you this&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Master Anthony Thom</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get Peter Bateman&rsquo;s cuddy to
      come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;And has my Anthony Thom walked all the way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Master Anthony Thom</i>&mdash;&ldquo;No; I got a cast in Jackey Lishman the
      chimbley-sweep&rsquo;s car as far as Burnfoot Bridge. I&rsquo;ve walked from there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Bless his sweet heart! And had he his worsted
      comforter on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Master Anthony Thom</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; goloshes and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, goloshes are capital things. They keep the
      feet, warm, and prevent your footsteps from being heard. And has my
      Anthony Thom got the letter I wrote to him at the Sun in the Sands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Master Anthony Thom</i>&mdash;&ldquo;No, never heard nothin&rsquo; of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum&mdash;&ldquo;No!</i> Why what can ha&rsquo; got it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Master Anthony Thom</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know.&mdash;Makes no odds.&mdash;I
      got the things all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;O, but my own dear Anthony Thom, but it does.
      Mr. Gerge Gallon says it&rsquo;s very foolish for people to write anything if
      they can &lsquo;elp it&mdash;they should always send messages by word of mouth.
      Mr. Gallon is a man of great intellect, and I&rsquo;m sure what he says is
      right, and I wish I had it back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Master Anthony Thom</i>&mdash;&ldquo;O, it&rsquo;ll cast up some day, I&rsquo;ll be
      bound.&mdash;It&rsquo;s of no use to nobody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;I hope so, my dear. But it is not pleasant to
      think other folks may read what was only meant for my own Anthony Thom.
      However, it&rsquo;s no use crying over spilt milk, and we must manish better
      another time. So now look out, my beloved, and I&rsquo;ll lower what I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, a grating of cord against the window-sill announced a descent,
      and Master Anthony Thom, grasping the load, presently cried, &ldquo;All right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not too heavy for you, is it, dear?&rdquo; <i>Master
      Anthony Thom</i> (hugging the package)&mdash;&ldquo;O, no; I can manish it. When
      shall I come again, then, mother?&rdquo; asked he, preparing to be off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mrs. Margerum</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, bless your sweet voice, my beloved. When
      shall you come again, indeed? I wish I could say very soon; but, dearest,
      it&rsquo;s hardly safe, these nasty pollis fellers are always about, besides
      which, I question if old Nosey may be away again before the ball; and as
      he&rsquo;ll be all on the screw for a while, to make up for past expense, I
      question it will be worth coming before then. So, my own dear Anthony
      Thom, s&rsquo;pose we say the ball night, dear, about this time o&rsquo; night, and
      get a donkey to come on as far as the gates, if you can, for I dread the
      fatigue; and if you could get a pair of panniers, so much the better,
      you&rsquo;d ride easier, and carry your things better, and might have a few
      fire-bricks or hearth-stones to put at the top, to pretend you were
      selling them, in case you were stopped&mdash;which, however, I hope won&rsquo;t
      be the case, my own dear; but you can&rsquo;t be too careful, for it&rsquo;s a sad,
      sinful world, and people don&rsquo;t care what they say of their neighbours. So
      now, my own dearest Anthony Thom, good night, and draw your worsted
      comforter close round your throat, for colds are the cause of half our
      complaints, and the night air is always to be dreaded; and take care that
      you don&rsquo;t overheat yourself, but get a lift as soon as you can, only mind
      who it is with, and don&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;ve been here, and be back on the ball
      night. So good night, my own dearest Anthony Thom, and take care of
      yourself whatever you do, for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, mother,&rdquo; now interrupted Anthony Thom, adjusting the bundle
      under his arm, and with repeated &ldquo;Good night, my own dearest,&rdquo; from her,
      he gave it a finishing jerk, and turning round, set off on his way
      rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses was too good a sportsman to holloa before his game was clear of
      the cover; and he not only let Anthony Thom&rsquo;s footsteps die out on the
      gravel-walk, but the sash of Mrs. Margerum&rsquo;s window descend ere he
      withdrew from his hiding-place and set off in pursuit. He then went
      tip-toeing along after him, and was soon within hearing of the heavily
      laden lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anthony Thom, my dear! Anthony Thom,&rdquo; whispered he, coming hastily upon
      him as he now turned the corner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony Thom stopped, and trembling violently exclaimed, &ldquo;O Mr. Gallon, is
      it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, it&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; replied Sir Moses, adding, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> a
      great parcel, my dear; let me carry it for you,&rdquo; taking it from him as he
      spoke.
    </p>

    <h4>
      <a href="images/441.jpg"><i>Original Size</i></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Shriek! shriek! scream!</i>&rdquo; now went the terrified Thom, seeing into
      whose hands he had fallen. &ldquo;O you dom&rsquo;d young rascal,&rdquo; exclaimed Sir
      Moses, muffling him with his wrapper,&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll draw and quarter you if
      you make any noise. Come this way, you young miscreant!&rdquo; added he, seizing
      him by the worsted comforter and dragging him along past the front of the
      house to the private door in the wall, through which Sir Moses disappeared
      when he wanted to evade Mon s. Rougier&rsquo;s requirements for his
      steeple-chase money.
    </p>
    <p>
      That passed, they were in the stable-yard, now silent save the occasional
      stamp of the foot or roll of the halter of some horse that had not yet
      lain down. Sir Moses dragged his victim to the door in the corner leading
      to the whipper-in&rsquo;s bedroom, which, being open, he proceeded to grope his
      way up stairs. &ldquo;Harry! Joe! Joe! Harry!&rdquo; holloaed he, kicking at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Harry was away, but Joe was in bed; indeed he was having a hunt in
      his sleep, and exclaimed as the door at length yielded to the pressure of
      Sir Moses&rsquo; foot. &ldquo;&lsquo;Od rot it! Don&rsquo;t ride so near the hounds, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; repeated Sir Moses, making up to the corner from whence the sound
      proceeded. &ldquo;Joe! Joe!&rdquo; roared he still louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, I beg your pardon! I&rsquo;ll open the gate!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, now throwing
      off the bed-clothes and bounding vigorously on to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloa!&rdquo; exclaimed he, awaking and rubbing his eyes. &ldquo;Holloa! who&rsquo;s
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, &ldquo;me,&rdquo;&mdash;adding: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a row, but strike a
      light as quick as you can; I&rsquo;ve got a bag fox I want to show you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bag fox, have you?&rdquo; replied Joe, now recognising his master&rsquo;s voice,
      making for the mantel-piece and feeling for the box. &ldquo;Bag fox, have you?
      Dreamt we were in the middle of a run from Ripley Coppice, and that I
      couldn&rsquo;t get old Crusader over the brook at no price.&rdquo; He then hit upon
      the box, and with a scrape of a lucifer the room was illuminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having lit a mould candle that stood stuck in the usual pint-bottle neck,
      Joe came with it in his hand to receive the instructions of his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a dom&rsquo;d young scoundrel I&rsquo;ve caught lurking about the house,&rdquo; said
      Sir Moses, pushing Anthony Thom towards him &ldquo;and I want you to give him a
      good hiding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Sir Moses; certainly,&rdquo; replied Joe, taking Anthony Thom by the
      ear as he would a hound, and looking him over amid the whining and
      whimpering and beggings for mercy of the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why this is the young rascal that stole my Sunday shirt off Mrs.
      Saunders&rsquo;s hedge!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe, getting a glimpse of Anthony Thom&rsquo;s
      clayey complexioned face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; whined the boy. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not. I never did nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the
      sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the sort!&rdquo; retorted Joe, &ldquo;why there ain&rsquo;t two hugly boys with
      hare lips a runnin&rsquo; about the country,&rdquo; pulling down the red-worsted
      comforter, and exposing the deformity as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you all over,&rdquo; continued he, seizing a spare stirrup leather, and
      proceeding to administer the buckle-end most lustily. Anthony Thom
      shrieked and screamed, and yelled and kicked, and tried to bite; but Joe
      was an able practitioner, and Thom could never get a turn at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished one side, Joe then turned him over, and gave him a
      duplicate beating on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! that&rsquo;ll do: kick him down stairs!&rdquo; at length cried Sir Moses,
      thinking Joe had given him enough; and as the boy went bounding head
      foremost down, he dropped into his mother&rsquo;s arms, who, hearing his
      screams, had come to the rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe and his master then opened the budget and found the following goods:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      2 lb. of tea, 1 bar of brown soap in a dirty cotton night-cap, marked C.
      F.; doubtless, as Sir Moses said, one of Cuddy Flintoff&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dom all such dripping,&rdquo; said Sir Moses, as he desired Joe to carry the
      things to the house. &ldquo;No wonder that I drank a great deal of tea,&rdquo; added
      he, as Joe gathered them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the deuce would keep house that could help it?&rdquo; muttered Sir Moses,
      proceeding on his way to the mansion, thinking what a trouncing he would
      give Mrs. Margerum ere he turned her out of doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 lb. of coffee
    </p>
    <p>
      3 lb. of brown sugar
    </p>

      3 lb. of starch

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIX.<br/>ANOTHER COUNCIL OF WAR.&mdash;MR. GALLON AT HOME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>RS. Margerum
      having soothed and pressed her beautiful boy to her bosom, ran into the
      house, and hurrying on the everlasting pheasant-feather bonnet in which
      she was first introduced to the reader, and a faded red and green tartan
      cloak hanging under it, emerged at the front door just as Sir Moses and
      Joe entered at the back one, vowing that she would have redress if it cost
      her a fi&rsquo; pun note. Clutching dear Anthony Thom by the waist, she made the
      best of her way down the evergreen walk, and skirting the gardens, got
      upon the road near the keeper&rsquo;s lodge. &ldquo;Come along, my own dear Anthony
      Thom,&rdquo; cried she, helping him along, &ldquo;let us leave this horrid wicked
      hole.&mdash;Oh, dear! I wish I&rsquo;d never set foot in it; but I&rsquo;ll not have
      my Anthony Thom chastised by any nasty old clothesman&mdash;no, that I
      won&rsquo;t, if it cost me a fifty pun note&rdquo;&mdash;continued she, burning for
      vengeance. But Anthony Thom had been chastised notwithstanding, so well,
      indeed, that he could hardly hobble&mdash;seeing which, Mrs. Margerum
      halted, and again pressing him to her bosom, exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, my beloved
      Anthony Thom can&rsquo;t travel; I&rsquo;ll take him and leave him at Mr. Hindmarch&rsquo;s,
      while I go and consult Mr. Gallon.&rdquo;&mdash;So saying, she suddenly changed
      her course, and crossing Rye-hill green, and the ten-acre field adjoining,
      was presently undergoing the <i>wow-wow wow-wow</i> of the farmer lawyer&rsquo;o
      dog, Towler. The lawyer, ever anxious for his poultry, was roused by the
      noise; and after a rattle of bolts, and sliding of a sash, presented his
      cotton night-capped head at an upper window, demanding in a stentorian
      voice &ldquo;who was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! Mr. Hindmarch, me! Mrs. Margerum; for pity&rsquo;s sake take us in, for my
      poor dear boy&rsquo;s been most shemfully beat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beat, has he!&rdquo; exclaimed the lawyer, recognising the voice, his ready wit
      jumping to an immediate conclusion; &ldquo;beat, has he!&rdquo; repeated he,
      withdrawing from the window to fulfil her behest, adding to himself as he
      struck a light and descended the staircase, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; summut to do with
      the dripping, I guess&mdash;always thought it would come to mischief at
      last.&rdquo; The rickety door being unbolted and opened, Mrs. Margerum and her
      boy entered, and Mrs. Hindmarch having also risen and descended, the
      embers of the kitchen fire were resuscitated, and Anthony Thom was
      examined by the united aid of a tallow candle and it. &ldquo;Oh, see! see!&rdquo;
       cried Mrs. Margerum, pointing out the wales on his back,&mdash;&ldquo;was there
      ever a boy so shemfully beat? But I&rsquo;ll have revenge on that villainous
      man,&mdash;that I will, if it cost me a hundred pun note.&rdquo;&mdash;The marks
      seen, soothed, and deplored, Mr. Hindmarch began inquiring who had done
      it. &ldquo;Done it! that nasty old Nosey,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Margerum, her eyes
      flashing with fire; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll make the mean feller pay for it,&rdquo; added she,&mdash;&ldquo;that
      I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t old No-No-Nosey, mo-mo-mother,&rdquo; now sobbed Anthony Thom,
      &ldquo;it was that nasty Joe Ski-Ski-Skinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skinner, was it, my priceless jewel,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Margerum, kissing him,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll skin him; but Nosey was there, wasn&rsquo;t he, my pet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, Nosey was there,&rdquo; replied Anthony Thom, &ldquo;it was him that took me
      to Ski-Ski-Skinner&rdquo;&mdash;the boy bursting out into a fresh blubber, and
      rubbing his dirty knuckles into his streaming eyes as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O that Skinner&rsquo;s a bad un,&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Margerum, &ldquo;always said he was a
      mischievous, dangerous man; but I&rsquo;ll have satisfaction of both him and old
      Nosey,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The particulars of the catastrophe being at length related (at least as
      far as it suited Mrs. Margerum to tell it), the kettle was presently put
      on the renewed fire, a round table produced, and the usual consolation of
      the black bottle resorted to. Then as the party sat sipping their grog, a
      council of war was held as to the best course of proceeding. Lawyer
      Hindmarch was better versed in the law of landlord and tenant&mdash;the
      best way of a tenant doing his landlord,&mdash;than in the more recondite
      doctrine of master and servant, particularly the delicate part relating to
      perquisites; and though he thought Sir Moses had done wrong in beating the
      boy, he was not quite sure but there might be something in the boy being
      found about the house at an unseasonable hour of the night. Moreover, as
      farming times were getting dull, and the lawyer was meditating a slope <i>à
      la</i> Henerey Brown &amp; Co.? he did not wish to get mixed up in a case
      that might bring him in collision with Sir Moses or his agent, so he
      readily adopted Mrs. Margerum&rsquo;s suggestion of going to consult Mr. George
      Gallon. He really thought Mr. Gallon would be the very man for her to see.
      Geordey was up to everything, and knew nicely what people could stand by,
      and what they could not; and lawyer Hindmarch was only sorry his old grey
      gig-mare was lame, or he would have driven her up to George&rsquo;s at once.
      However, there was plenty of time to get there on foot before morning, and
      they would take care of Anthony Thom till she came back, only she must be
      good enough not to return till nightfall; for that nasty suspicious Nathan
      was always prowling about, and would like nothing better than to get him
      into mischief with Sir Moses.&mdash;And that point being settled, they
      replenished their glasses, and drank success to the mission; and having
      seen the belaboured Anthony Thom safe in a shakedown, Mrs. Margerum
      borrowed Mrs. Hindmarch&rsquo;s second best bonnet, a frilled and beaded black
      velvet one with an ostrich feather, and her polka jacket, and set off on
      foot for the Rose and Crown beer-shop, being escorted to their door by her
      host and hostess, who assured her it wouldn&rsquo;t be so dark when she got away
      from the house a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that point being accomplished, lawyer and Mrs. Hindmarch retired to
      rest, wishing they were as well rid of Anthony Thom, whom they made no
      doubt had got into a sad scrape, in which they wished they mightn&rsquo;t be
      involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sluggish winter&rsquo;s day was just dragging its lazy self into existence as
      Mrs. Margerum came within sight of Mr. Gallon&rsquo;s red-topped roof at the
      four lane ends, from whose dumpy chimney the circling curl of a wood fire
      was just emerging upon the pure air. As she got nearer, the early-stirring
      Mr. Gallon himself crossed the road to the stable, attired in the baggy
      velveteen shooting-jacket of low with the white cords and shining
      pork-butcher&rsquo;s top-boots of high life. Mr. Gallon was going to feed Tippy
      Tom before setting off for the great open champion coursing meeting to be
      held on Spankerley Downs, &ldquo;by the kind permission of Sir Harry Fuzball,
      Baronet,&rdquo; it being one of the peculiar features of the day that gentlemen
      who object to having their game killed in detail, will submit to its going
      wholesale, provided it is done with a suitable panegyrick. &ldquo;By the kind
      permission of Sir Harry Fuzball, Baronet,&rdquo; or &ldquo;by leave of the lord of the
      manor of Flatshire,&rdquo; and so on; and thus every idler who can&rsquo;t keep
      himself is encouraged to keep a greyhound, to the detriment of a nice
      lady-like amusement, and the encouragement of gambling and poaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gallon was to be field steward of this great open champion meeting,
      and had been up betimes, polishing off Tippy Tom; which having done, he
      next paid a similar compliment to his own person; and now again was going
      to feed the flash high-stepping screw, ere he commenced with his
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Margerum&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>hie Mr. Gallon, hie!</i>&rdquo; and up-raised hand, as she
      hurried down the hill towards his house, arrested his progress as he
      passed to the stable with the sieve, and he now stood biting the oats, and
      eyeing her approach with the foreboding of mischief that so seldom
      deceives one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mr. Gallon! O Mr. Gallon!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Margerum, tottering up, and
      dropping her feathered head on his brawny shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s oop? What&rsquo;s oop?</i>&rdquo; eagerly demanded our sportsman, fearing
      for his fair character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mr. Gallon! <i>such</i> mischief! <i>such</i> mischief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, woman! speak!&rdquo; demanded our publican; &ldquo;say, <i>has he cotched ye?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gerge, yes,&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Margerum, bursting into tears. &ldquo;To devil he
      has!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Gallon, stamping furiously with his right foot, &ldquo;Coom
      into it hoose, woman; coom into it hoose, and tell us arl aboot it.&rdquo; So
      saying, forgetting Tippy Toni&rsquo;s wants, he retraced his steps with the
      corn, and flung frantically into the kitchen of his little two-roomed
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, lassie!&rdquo; cried he, to a little girl, who was frying a dish of
      bubble-and-squeak at the fire. &ldquo;Here, lassie, set doon it pan loike, aud
      tak this corn to it huss, and stand by while it eats it so saying he
      handed her the sieve, and following her to the door, closed it upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noo,&rdquo; said he to Mrs. Margerum, &ldquo;sit doon and tell us arl aboot it. Who
      cotched ye? Nosey, or who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;0 it wasn&rsquo;t me! It was Anthony Thom they caught, and they used him most
      shemful; but I&rsquo;ll have him tried for his life ofore my Lord Size, and
      transported, if it costs me all I&rsquo;m worth in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anthony Thom was it?&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Gallon, raising his great eye-brows,
      and staring wide his saucer eyes, &ldquo;Anthony Thom was it? but he&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; 
      nothin&rsquo; upon oi &lsquo;ope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;, Gerge,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Margerum, &ldquo;nothin&rsquo;&mdash;less now it might
      just appen to be an old rag of a night-eap of that nasty, covetous body
      Cuddy Flintoff; but whether it had a mark upon it or not I really can&rsquo;t
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear, but that&rsquo;s a bad job,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Gallon, biting his lips and
      shaking his great bull-head; &ldquo;O dear, but that&rsquo;s a bad job. you know I
      always chairged ye to be careful &lsquo;boot unlawful goods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did, Gerge! you did!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Margerum; &ldquo;and if this old rag had
      a mark, it was a clear oversight. But, O dear!&rdquo; continued she, bursting
      into tears, &ldquo;how they did <i>beat</i> my Anthony Thom!&rdquo; With this relief
      she became more composed, and proceeded to disclose all the particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, this &lsquo;ill be a trick of those nasty pollis fellers,&rdquo; observed Mr.
      Gallon thoughtfully, &ldquo;oi know&rsquo;d they&rsquo;d be the ruin o&rsquo; trade as soon as
      ever they came into it country loike&mdash;nasty pokin&rsquo;, pryin&rsquo;,
      mischievous fellers. Hoosomiver it mun be seen to, aud that quickly,&rdquo;
       continued he. &ldquo;for it would damage me desp&rsquo;rate on the Torf to have ony
      disturbance o&rsquo; this sorrt, and we mun stop it if we can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, lassie!&rdquo; cried he to the little girl who had now returned from the
      stable, &ldquo;lay cloth i&rsquo; next room foike, and then finish the fryin&rsquo;; and
      oi&rsquo;ll tell ve what,&rdquo; continued he, laying his huge hand on Mrs. Margerum&rsquo;s
      shoulder, &ldquo;oi&rsquo;ve got to go to it champion cooursin&rsquo; meetin&rsquo;, so I&rsquo;ll just
      put it hus into harness and droive ye round by it Bird-i&rsquo;-the-Bush, where
      we&rsquo;ll find Carroty Kebbel, who&rsquo;ll tell us what te do, for oi don&rsquo;t like
      the noight-cap business some hoo,&rdquo; so saying Mr. Gallon took his silver
      plated harness down from its peg in the kitchen, and proceeded to
      caparison Tippy Tom, while the little girl, now assisted by Mrs. Margerum,
      prepared the breakfast, and set it on the table. Rather a sumptuous repast
      they had, considering it was only a way-side beer-shop; bubble-and-squeak,
      reindeer-tongue, potted game, potted shrimps, and tea strikingly like some
      of Sir Moses&rsquo;s. The whole being surmounted with a glass a-piece of pure
      British gin, Mr. Gallon finished his toilette, and then left to put the
      high-stepping screw into the light spring-cart, while Mrs. Margerum
      reviewed her visage in the glass, and as the openworks clock in the
      kitchen struck nine, they were dashing down the Heatherbell-road at the
      rate of twelve miles an hour.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LX.<br/>MR. CARROTY KEBBEL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>R. Carroty Kebbel
      was a huge red-haired, Crimean-bearded, peripatetic attorney, who
      travelled from petty sessions to petty sessions, spending his intermediate
      time at the public houses, ferreting out and getting up cases. He was a
      roistering ruffian, who contradicted everybody, denied everything, and
      tried to get rid of what he couldn&rsquo;t answer with a horse-laugh. He was in
      good practice, for he allowed the police a liberal per-centage for
      bringing him prosecutions, while his bellowing bullying insured him plenty
      of defences on his own account. He was retained by half the ragamuffins in
      the country. He had long been what Mr. Gallon not inaptly called his
      &ldquo;liar,&rdquo; and had done him such good service as to earn free quarters at the
      Rose and Crown whenever he liked to call. He had been there only the day
      before, in the matter of an <i>alibi</i> he was getting up for our old
      hare-finding friend Springer, who was most unhandsomely accused of
      night-poaching in Lord Oilcake&rsquo;s preserves, and that was how Mr. Gallon
      knew where to find him. The Crumpletin railway had opened out a fine
      consecutive line of petty sessions, out of which Carrots had carved a
      &ldquo;home circuit&rdquo; of his own. He was then on his return tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the sprightly exertions of Tippy Tom, Gallon and Mrs. Margerum were
      soon within sight of the Bird-in-the-Bush Inn, at which Gallon drew up
      with a dash. Carrots, however, had left some half-hour before, taking the
      road for Farningford, where the petty sessions were about to be held; and
      though this was somewhat out of Gallon&rsquo;s way to Spankerley Downs, yet the
      urgency of the case determined him to press on in pursuit, and try to see
      Carrots. Tippy Tom, still full of running, went away again like a shot,
      and bowling through Kimberley toll-bar with the air of a man who was free,
      Gallon struck down the Roughfield road to the left, availing himself of
      the slight fall of the ground to make the cart run away with the horse, as
      it were, and so help him up the opposing hill. That risen, they then got
      upon level ground; and, after bowling along for about a mile or so, were
      presently cheered with the sight of the black wide-awake crowned lawyer
      striding away in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carrots was a disciple of the great Sir Charles Napier, who said that a
      change of linen, a bit of soap, and a comb were kit enough for any one;
      and being only a two-shirts-a-week man, he generally left his &ldquo;other&rdquo; one
      at such locality as he was likely to reach about the middle of it, so as
      to apportion the work equally between them. This was clean-shirt day with
      him, and he was displaying his linen in the ostentatious way of a man
      little accustomed to the luxury. With the exception of a
      lavender-and-white coloured watch-ribbon tie, he was dressed in a complete
      suit of black-grounded tweed, with the purple dots of an incipient rash,
      the coat having capacious outside pockets, and the trousers being now
      turned up at the bottoms to avoid the mud; &ldquo;showing&rdquo; rhinoceros hide-like
      shoes covering most formidable-looking feet. Such was the monster who was
      now swinging along the highway at the rate of five miles an hour, in the
      full vigour of manhood, and the pride of the morning. At the sight of him
      in advance, Mr. Gallon just touched Tippy Tom with the point of the whip,
      which the animal resented with a dash at the collar and a shake of the
      head, that as good as said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not do that again, master,
      unless you wish to take your vehicle home in a sack.&rdquo; Mr. Gallon therefore
      refrained, enlisting the aid of his voice instead, and after a series of
      those slangey-whiney <i>yaah-hoo! yaah-hoo&rsquo;s!</i> that the
      swell-stage-coachmen, as they called the Snobs, used to indulge in to
      clear the road or attract attention, Mr. Gallon broke out into a good
      downright &ldquo;Holloa, Mr. Kebbel! Holloa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his name, Carrots, who was spouting his usual exculpatory
      speech, vowing he felt certain no bench of Justices would convict on such
      evidence, and so on, pulled up; and Mr. Gallon, waving his whip over his
      head, he faced about, and sat down on a milestone to wait his coming. The
      vehicle was presently alongside of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holloa, George!&rdquo; exclaimed Carrots, rising and shaking hands with his
      client. &ldquo;Holloa! What&rsquo;s up? Who&rsquo;s this you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo; looking intently at
      Mrs. Margerum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said George, easing the now quivering-tailed Tippy Tom&rsquo;s
      head; &ldquo;this is Mrs. Margerum you&rsquo;ve heard me speak &lsquo;boot; and she&rsquo;s loike
      to get into a little trooble loike; and I tell&rsquo;d her she&rsquo;d best see a
      &lsquo;liar&rsquo; as soon as she could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; nodded Kebbel, anticipating what had happened. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo;
       continued Mr. Gallon, winding his whip thong round the stick as he spoke
      &ldquo;in packing up some little bit things in a hurry loike, she put up a
      noight cap, and she&rsquo;s not quoite sure whether she can stand by it or not,
      ye know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; assented Carrots; &ldquo;and they&rsquo;ve got it, I &lsquo;spose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that they got it,&rdquo; now interposed Mrs. Margerum; &ldquo;but they
      got my Anthony Thom, and beat him most shameful. Can&rsquo;t I have redress for
      my Anthony Thom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Carrots, resuming his seat on the milestone, and
      proceeding to elicit all particulars, beginning with the usual important
      inquiry, whether Anthony Thom had said anything or not. Finding he had
      not, Carrots took courage, and seemed inclined to make light of the
      matter. &ldquo;The groceries you bought, of course,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of Roger Rounding
      the basket-man&mdash;Roger will swear anything for me; and as for the
      night-cap, why say it was your aunt&rsquo;s, or your niece&rsquo;s, or your sister&rsquo;s&mdash;Caroline
      Somebody&rsquo;s&mdash;Caroline Frazer&rsquo;s, Charlotte Friar&rsquo;s, anybody&rsquo;s whose
      initials are C. F.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O! but it wasn&rsquo;t a woman&rsquo;s night-cap, sir, it was a man&rsquo;s; the sort of
      cap they hang folks in; and I should like to hang Old Mosey for beating my
      Anthony Thom,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Margerum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we can&rsquo;t hang him for that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Kebbel, laughing.
      &ldquo;Might have him up for the assault, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have him up for the assault,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Margerum; &ldquo;have him up
      for the assault. What business had he to beat my Anthony Thom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get him fined a shilling, and have to pay your own costs, perhaps,&rdquo;
       observed Mr. Kebbel; &ldquo;better leave that alone, and stick to the parcel
      business&mdash;better stick to the parcel business. There are salient
      points in the case. The hour of the night is an awkward part,&rdquo; continued
      he, biting his nails; &ldquo;not but that the thing is perfectly capable of
      explanation, only the Beaks don&rsquo;t like that sort of work, it won&rsquo;t do for
      us to provoke an inquiry into the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; assented Mr. Gallon, who thought Mrs. Margerum had better be
      quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but it&rsquo;s hard that my Anthony Thom&rsquo;s to be beat, and get no
      redress!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Margerum, bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, woman! hush!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Gallon, giving her a dig in the ribs
      with his elbow; adding, &ldquo;ye mun de what it liar tells ye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I can do,&rdquo; continued Mr. Kebbel, after a pause.
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got my old friend Mark Bull, the ex-Double-im-up-shire Super,
      into this force, and think him a great card. I&rsquo;ll get him to go to Sir
      Moses about the matter; and if Mark finds we are all right about the cap,
      he&rsquo;s the very man to put Mosey up to a prosecution, and then we shall make
      a rare harvest out of him,&rdquo; Carrots rubbing his hands with glee at the
      idea of an action for a malicious prosecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;ll be the gam,&rdquo; said Mr. Gallon, chuckling,&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;ll be
      the gam; far better nor havin&rsquo; of him oop for the &lsquo;sult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Mr. Kebbel, &ldquo;I think so; at all events I&rsquo;ll consider
      the matter; and if I send Mark to Sir Moses, I&rsquo;ll tell him to come round
      by your place and let you know what he does; but, in the meantime,&rdquo;
       continued Kebbel, rising and addressing Mrs. Margerum earnestly, &ldquo;<i>don&rsquo;t
      you answer any questions</i> to anybody, and tell Anthony Thom to hold his
      tongue too, and I&rsquo;ve no doubt Mr. Gallon and I&rsquo;ll make it all right;&rdquo; so
      saying, Mr. Kebbel shook hands with them both, and stalked on to his
      petty-sessional practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallon then coaxed Tippy Turn round, and, retracing his steps as far as
      Kimberley gate, paid the toll, and shot Mrs. Margerum out, telling her to
      make the best of her way back to the Rose and Crown, and stay there till
      he returned. Gallon then took the road to the right, leading on to the
      wide-extending Spankerley Downs; where, unharnessing Tippy Tom under lea
      of a secluded plantation, he produced a saddle and bridle from the back of
      the cart, which, putting on, he mounted the high-stepping white, and was
      presently among the coursers, the greatest man at the meeting, some of the
      yokels, indeed, taking him for Sir Harry Fuzball himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Mr. Mark Bull arrived at Sir Moses&rsquo;s, things had taken another
      turn, for the Baronet, in breaking open what he thought was one of Mrs.
      Margerum&rsquo;s boxes, had in reality got into Mr. Bankhead&rsquo;s, where, finding
      his ticket of leave, he was availing himself of that worthy&rsquo;s absence to
      look over the plate prior to dismissing him, and Sir Moses made so light
      of Anthony Thom&rsquo;s adventure that the Super had his trouble for nothing.
      Thus the heads of the house&mdash;<i>the</i> Mr. and Mrs. in fact, were
      cleared out in one and the same day, by no means an unusual occurrence in
      an establishment, after which of course Sir Moses was so inundated with
      stories against them, that he almost resolved to imitate his great
      predecessor&rsquo;s example and live at the Fox and Hounds Hotel at Hinton in
      future. To this place his mind was now more than ordinarily directed in
      consequence of the arrangements that were then making for the approaching
      Hunt Ball, to which long looked-for festival we will now request the
      company of the reader.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Hit-im and
      Hold-im shire hunt balls had long been celebrated for their matrimonial
      properties, as well for settling ripe flirtations, as for bringing to a
      close the billing and cooing of un-productive love, and opening fresh
      accounts with the popular firm of &ldquo;Cupid and Co.&rdquo; They were the greenest
      spot on the memory&rsquo;s waste of many, on the minds of some whose
      recollections carried them back to the romping, vigorous Sir Roger de
      Coverley dances of Mr. Customer&rsquo;s time,&mdash;of many who remembered the
      more stately glide of the elegant quadrille of Lord Martingal&rsquo;s reign,
      down to the introduction of the once scandalising waltz and polka of our
      own. Many &ldquo;Ask Mamma&rsquo;s&rdquo; had been elicited by these balls, and good luck
      was said to attend all their unions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great had been the changes in the manners and customs of the country, but
      the one dominant plain gold ring idea remained fixed and immutable. The
      Hit-im and Hold-im shire hunt ball was expected to furnish a great demand
      for these, and Garnet the silversmith always exhibited an elegant white
      satin-lined morocco case full in his window, in juxtaposition with rows of
      the bright dress-buttons of the hunt, glittering on beds of delicate
      rose-tinted tissue paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the milliners far and wide used to advertise their London and Parisian
      finery for the occasion, like our friend Mrs. Bobbinette,&mdash;for the
      railway had broken through the once comfortable monopoly that Mrs.
      Russelton and the Hinton ones formerly enjoyed, and had thrown crinoline
      providing upon the country at large. Indeed, the railway had deranged the
      old order of things; for whereas in former times a Doubleimnpshire or a
      Neck-and-Crop shire sportsman was rarely to be seen at the balls, aud
      those most likely under pressure of most urgent &ldquo;Ask Mamma&rdquo; circumstances,
      now they came swarming down like swallows, consuming a most unreasonable
      quantity of Champagne&mdash;always, of course, returning and declaring it
      was all &ldquo;gusberry.&rdquo; Formerly the ball was given out of the Hit-im and
      Hold-im shire hunt funds; but this unwonted accession so increased the
      expense, that Sir Moses couldn&rsquo;t stand it, dom&rsquo;d of he could; and he
      caused a rule to be passed, declaring that after a certain sum allowed by
      the club, the rest should be paid by a tax on the tickets, so that the
      guest-inviting members might pay for their friends. In addition to this, a
      sliding-seale of Champagne was adopted, beginning with good, and gradually
      relaxing in quality, until there is no saying but that some of the late
      sitters might get a little gooseberry. Being, however, only a guest, we
      ought not perhaps to be too critical in the matter, so we will pass on to
      the more general features of the entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We take it a woman&rsquo;s feelings and a man&rsquo;s feelings with regard to a ball
      are totally different and distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men&mdash;unmarried men, at least&mdash;know nothing of the intrinsic
      value of a dress, they look at the general effect on the figure. Piquant
      simplicity, something that the mind grasps at a glance and retains&mdash;such
      as Miss Yammerton&rsquo;s dress in the glove scene&mdash;is what they like. Many
      ladies indeed seem to get costly dresses in order to cover them over with
      something else, just as gentlemen build handsome lodges to their gates,
      and then block them out of sight by walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even if ball-dresses were as attractive to the gentlemen as the ladies
      seem to think them, they must remember the competition they have to
      undergo in a ball-room, where great home beauties may be suddenly eclipsed
      by unexpected rivals, and young gentlemen see that there are other angels
      in the world besides their own adored ones. Still balls are balls, and
      fashion is fashion, and ladies must conform to it, or what could induce
      them to introduce the bits of black of the present day into their coloured
      dresses, as if they were just emerging from mourning. Even our fair
      friends at Yammerton Grange conformed to the fashion, and edged the many
      pink satin-ribboned flounces of their white tulle dresses with narrow
      black lace&mdash;though they would have looked much prettier without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the balls given by the members of the Hit-im and Hold-im shire
      hunt, none had perhaps excitcd greater interest than the one about to take
      place, not only on account of its own intrinsic merits as a ball, but
      because of the many tender emotions waiting for solutions on that eventful
      evening. Among others it may be mentioned that our fat friend the
      Woolpack, whose portrait adorns page 241, had confided to Mrs. Rocket
      Larkspur, who kept a sort of register-office for sighers, his admiration
      of the fair auburn-haired Flora Yammerton; and Mrs. Rocket having duly
      communicated the interesting fact to the young lady, intimating, of
      course, that he would have the usual &ldquo;ten thousand a year,&rdquo; Flora had
      taken counsel with herself whether she had not better secure him, than
      contend with her elder sister either for Sir Moses or Mr. Pringle,
      especially as she did not much fancy Sir Moses, and Billy was very
      wavering in his attentions, sometimes looking extremely sweet at her,
      sometimes equally so at Clara, and at other times even smiling on that
      little childish minx Harriet. Indeed Mrs. Rocket Larkspur, in the
      multiplicity of her meddling, had got a sort of half-admission from that
      young owl, Rowley Abingdon, that he thought Harriet very pretty, and she
      felt inclined to fan the flame of that speculation too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Miss Fairey, of Yarrow Court, was coming, and it was reported that
      Miss de Glancey had applied for a ticket, in order to try and cut her out
      with the elegant Captain Languisher, of the Royal Hollyhock Hussars.
      Altogether it was expected to be a capital ball, both for dancers and
      lookers-on.
    </p>
    <p>
      People whose being&rsquo;s end and aim is gaiety, as they call converting night
      into day, in rolling from party to party, with all the means and
      appliances of London, can have little idea of the up-hill work it is in
      the country, getting together the ingredients of a great ball. The writing
      for rooms, the fighting for rooms&mdash;the bespeaking of horses, the not
      getting horses&mdash;the catching the train, the losing the train&mdash;above
      all, the choosing and ordering those tremendous dresses, with the dread of
      not getting those tremendous dresses, of their being carried by in the
      train, or not fitting when they come. Nothing but the indomitable love of
      a ball, as deeply implanted in a woman&rsquo;s heart as the love of a hunt is in
      that of a man, can account for the trouble and vexation they undergo.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if &rsquo;tis a toil to the guests, what must it be to the givers, with no
      friendly Grange or Gunter at hand to supply everything, guests included,
      if required, at so much per head! Youth, glorious youth, comes to the aid,
      aud enters upon the labour with all the alacrity that perhaps
      distinguished their fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now suppose the absorbing evening come; and that all-important
      element in country festivities, the moon shining with silvery dearness as
      well on the railway gliders as on the more patient plodders by the road.
      What a converging there was upon the generally quiet town of Hinton;
      reminding the older inhabitants of the best days of Lord Martingal and Mr.
      Customer&rsquo;s reigns. What a gathering up there was of shining satins and
      rustling silks and moire antiques, white, pink, blue, yellow, green, to
      say nothing of clouds of tulle; what a compression of swelling eider-down
      and watch-spring petticoats; and what a bolt-upright sitting of that happy
      pride which knows no pain, as party after party took up and proceeded to
      the scene of hopes and fears at the Fox and Hounds Hotel and Posting
      House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ball-room was formed of the entire suite of first-floor front
      apartments, which, on ordinary occasions, did duty as private rooms&mdash;private,
      at least, as far as thin deal partitions could make them so&mdash;and the
      supper was laid out in our old acquaintance the club-room, connected by a
      sort of Isthmus of Suez, with a couple of diminutive steps towards the end
      to shoot the incautious becomingly, headforemost, into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carriages set down under the arched doorway, and a little along the
      passage the Blenheim was converted into a cloak-room for the ladies, where
      the voluminous dresses were shook out, and the last hurried glances
      snatched amid anxious groups of jostling arrivals. Gentlemen then emerging
      from the commercial room rejoined their fair friends in the passage, and
      were entrusted with fans and flowers while, with both hands, they steered
      their balloon-like dresses up the red druggetted staircase.

    <p>
      Gentlemen&rsquo;s balls have the advantage over those given by ladies, inasmuch
      as the gentlemen must be there early to receive their fair guests; and as
      a ball can always begin as soon as there are plenty of gentlemen, there
      are not those tedious delays and gatherings of nothing but crinoline that
      would only please Mr. Spurgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large highly-glazed, gilt-lettered, yellow card of invitation,
      intimated nine o&rsquo;clock as the hour; by which time most of the Hinton
      people were ready, and all the outlying ones were fast drawing towards the
      town. Indeed, there was nothing to interfere with the dancing festivities,
      for dinner giving on a ball night is not popular with the ladies&mdash;enough
      for the evening being the dance thereof. Country ladies are not like
      London ones, who can take a dinner, an opera, two balls, and an at-home in
      one and the same night. As to the Hinton gentlemen, they were very
      hospitable so long as nobody wanted anything from them; if they did, they
      might whistle a long time before they got it. If, for instance, that
      keeper of a house of call for Bores, Paul Straddler, saw a mud-sparked man
      with a riding-whip in his hand, hurrying about the town, he would after
      him, and press him to dine off, perhaps, &ldquo;crimped cod and oyster sauce,
      and a leg of four year old mutton, with a dish of mince pies or woodcocks,
      whichever he preferred;&rdquo; but on a ball night, when it would be a real
      convenience to a man to have a billet, Paul never thought of asking any
      one, though when he met his friends in the ball, and heard they had been
      uncomfortable at the Sun or the Fleece, he would exclaim, with
      well-feigned reproach, &ldquo;Oh dash it, man, why didn&rsquo;t you come to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But let us away to the Fox and Hounds, and see what is going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see the repugnance people have to being early at a ball, one would
      wonder how dancing ever gets begun. Yet somebody must be there first,
      though we question whether any of our fair readers ever performed the
      feat; at all events, if ever they did, we will undertake to say they have
      taken very good care not to repeat the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Blurkinses were the first to arrive on this occasion, having only
      themselves to think about, and being anxious, as they said, to see as much
      as they could for their money. Then having been duly received by Sir Moses
      and the gallant circle of fox-hunters, and passed inwardly, they took up a
      position so as to be able to waylay those who came after with their coarse
      compliments, beginning with Mrs. Dotherington, who, Blurkins declared, had
      worn the grey silk dress she then had on, ever since he knew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Jarperson, the Laughing Hyæna, next came under his notice, Blurkins
      telling him that his voice grated on his ear like a file; asking if any
      body else had ever told him so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Rocket Larkspur, who was duly distended in flaming red satin, was
      told she was like a full-blown peony; and young Treadcroft was asked if he
      knew that people called him the Woolpack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mrs. Blurkins kept pinching and feeling the ladies&rsquo; dresses as
      they passed, making a mental estimate of their cost. She told Miss
      Yammerton she had spoilt her dress by the black lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      A continuously ascending stream of crinoline at length so inundated the
      room, that by ten o&rsquo;clock Sir Moses thought it was time to open the ball;
      so deputing Tommy Heslop to do the further honours at the door, he sought
      Lady Fuzball, and claimed the favour of her hand for the first quadrille.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a signal for the unmated ones to pair; and forthwith there was
      such a drawing on of gloves, such a feeling of ties, such a rising on
      tiptoes, and straining of eyes, and running about, asking for Miss This,
      and Miss That, and if anybody had seen anything of Mrs. So-and-so.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the sought ones were found, anxiety abated, and the glad couples
      having secured suitable <i>vis-à-vis</i>, proceeded to take up positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a flourish of the leader&rsquo;s baton, the enlivening &ldquo;La Traviata&rdquo; struck
      up, and away the red coats and black coats went sailing and sinking, and
      rising and jumping, and twirling with the lightly-floating dresses of the
      ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;Pelissier Galop&rdquo; quickly followed, then the &ldquo;Ask Mamma Polka,&rdquo; and
      just as the music ceased, and the now slightly-flushed couples were
      preparing for a small-talk promenade, a movement took place near the door,
      and the elegant swan-like de Glancey was seen sailing into the room with
      her scarlet-geranium-festooned dress set off with eight hundred yards of
      tulle! Taking her chaperone Mrs. Roseworth&rsquo;s arm, she came sailing
      majestically along, the men all alive for a smile, the ladies laughing at
      what they called her preposterous dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But de Glancey was not going to defeat her object by any premature
      condescension; so she just met the men&rsquo;s raptures with the slightest
      recognition of her downcast eyes, until she encountered the gallant
      Captain Languisher with lovely Miss Fairey on his arm, when she gave him
      one of her most captivating smiles, thinking to have him away from Miss
      Fairey in no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss de Glancey was too late! The Captain had just &ldquo;popped the
      question,&rdquo; and was then actually on his way to &ldquo;Ask Mamma,&rdquo; and so
      returned her greeting with an air of cordial indifference, that as good as
      said, &ldquo;Ah, my dear, you&rsquo;ll not do for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss de Glancey was shocked. It was the first time in her life that she
      had ever missed her aim. Nor was her mortification diminished by the cool
      way our hero, Mr. Pringle, next met her advances. She had been so
      accustomed to admiration, that she could ill brook the want of it, and the
      double blow was too much for her delicate sensibilities. She felt faint,
      and as soon as she could get a fly large enough to hold herself and her
      chaperone, she withdrew, the mortification of this evening far more than
      counterbalancing all the previous triumphs of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One person more or less at a ball, however, is neither here nor there, and
      the music presently struck up again, and the whirling was resumed, just as
      if there was no such person as Miss de Glancey in existence. And thus
      waltz succeeded polka, and polka succeeded quadrille, with lively rapidity&mdash;every
      one declaring it was a most delightful ball, and wondering when supper
      would be.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length there was a lull, and certain unmistakeable symptoms announced
      that the hour for that superfluous but much talked of meal had arrived,
      whereupon there was the usual sorting of consequence to draw to the cross
      table at the top of the room, with the pairing off of eligible couples who
      could be trusted alone, and the shirking of Mammas by those who were not
      equally fortunate. Presently a movement was made towards the Isthmus of
      Suez, on reaching which the rotund ladies had to abandon their escorts to
      pilot their petticoats through the straits amid the cries of &ldquo;take care of
      the steps!&rdquo; &ldquo;mind the steps at the end!&rdquo; from those who knew the dangers
      of the passage. And thus the crinoline came circling into the supper room&mdash;each
      lady again expanding with the increased space, and reclaiming her beau.
      Supper being as we said before a superfluous meal, it should be light and
      airy, something to please the eye and tempt the appetite; not composed of
      great solid joints that look like a farmer&rsquo;s ordinary, or a rent-day
      dinner with &ldquo;night mare&rdquo; depicted on every dish. The Hit-im and Hold-im
      shire hunt balls had always been famous for the elegance of their supper,
      Lord Ladythorne kindly allowing his Italian confectioner, Signor
      Massaniello, to superintend the elegancies, that excited such admiration
      from the ladies as they worked their ways or wedged themselves in at the
      tables, but whose beauty did not save them from destruction as the evening
      advanced. At first of course the solids were untouched, the tongues, the
      hams, the chickens, the turkeys, the lobster salads, the nests of plover
      eggs, the clatter patter being relieved by a heavy salvo of Champagne
      artillery. Brisk was the demand for it at starting, for the economical
      arrangement was as well known as if it had been placarded about the room.
      When the storm of corks had subsided and clean plates been supplied, the
      sweets, the jellies, the confectionery were attacked, and occasional sly
      sorties were made against the flower sugar vases and ornaments of the
      table. Then perspiring waiters came panting in with more Champagne fresh
      out of the ice, and again arm-extended the glasses hailed its coming,
      though some of the Neck-and-Crop-shire gentlemen smacked their lips after
      drinking it, and pronounced it to be No. 2. Nevertheless they took some
      more when it came round again. At length the most voracious cormorant was
      appeased, and all eyes gradually turned towards the sporting president in
      the centre of the cross table.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have heard it said that the House of Commons is the most appalling and
      critical assembly in the world to address, but we confess we think a mixed
      party of ladies and gentlemen at a sit-down supper a more formidable
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      We don&rsquo;t know anything more painful than to hear a tongue-tied country
      gentleman floundering for words and scrambling after an idea that the
      quick-witted ladies have caught long before he comes within sight of his
      subject. Theirs is like the sudden dart of the elastic greyhound compared
      to the solemn towl of the old slow-moving &ldquo;southern&rdquo; hound after its game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Moses, however, as our readers know, was not one of the tongue-tied
      sort&mdash;on the contrary, he had a great flow of words and could palaver
      the ladies as well as the gentlemen. Indeed he was quite at home in that
      room where he had coaxed and wheedled subscriptions, promised wonders, and
      given away horses without the donees incurring any &ldquo;obligation.&rdquo;
       Accordingly at the fitting time he rose from his throne, and with one
      stroke of his hammer quelled the remaining conversation which had been
      gradually dying out in anticipation of what was coming. He then called for
      a bumper toast, and after alluding in felicitous terms to the happy event
      that so aroused the &ldquo;symphonies&rdquo; of old Wotherspoon, he concluded by
      proposing the health of her Majesty the Queen, which of course was drunk
      with three times three and one cheer more. The next toast, of course, was
      the ladies who had honoured the Ball with their presence, and certainly if
      ever ladies ought to be satisfied with the compliments paid them, it was
      on the present occasion, for Sir Moses vowed and protested that of all
      beauties the Hit-im and Hold-im shire beauties were the fairest, the
      brightest, and the best; and he said it would be a downright reflection
      upon the rising generation if they did not follow the Crown Prince of
      Prussia&rsquo;s excellent example, and make that ball to be the most blissful
      and joyous of their recollections. This toast being heartily responded to,
      Sir Moses leading the cheers, Sir Harry Fuzball rose to return thanks on
      behalf of the ladies, any one of whom could have done it a great deal
      better; after which old Sir George Persiflage, having arranged his
      lace-tipped tie, proposed the health of Sir Moses, and spoke of him in
      very different terms to what Sir Moses did of Sir George at the hunt
      dinner, and this, answer affording Sir Moses another opportunity&mdash;the
      good Champagne being exhausted&mdash;he renewed his former advice, and
      concluded by moving an adjournment to the ball-room. Then the weight of
      oratory being off, the school broke loose as it were, and all parties
      paired off as they liked. Many were the trips at the steps as they
      returned by the narrow passage to the ball-room. The &ldquo;Ask Mamma&rdquo; Polka
      then appropriately struck up, but polking being rather beyond our
      Baronet&rsquo;s powers he stood outside the ring rubbing his nose and eyeing the
      gay twirlers, taking counsel within himself what he should do. The state
      of his household had sorely perplexed him, aud he had about come to the
      resolution that he must either marry again or give up housekeeping and
      live at Hinton. Then came the question whom he should take? Now Mrs.
      Yammerton was a noted good manager, and in the inferential sort of way
      that we all sometimes deceive ourselves, he came to the conclusion that
      her daughters would be the same. Clara was very pretty&mdash;dom&rsquo;d if she
      wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;She would look very well at the head of his table, and just
      at the moment she came twirling past with Billy Pringle, the pearl loops
      of her pretty pink wreath dancing on her fair forehead. The Baronet was
      booked; &ldquo;he would have her, dom&rsquo;d if he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and taking courage
      within himself as the music ceased, he claimed her hand for the next
      quadrille, and leading her to the top of the dance, commenced joking her
      about Billy, who he said would make a very pretty girl, and then commenced
      praising herself. He admired her and everything she had on, from the
      wreath to her ribbon, and was so affectionate that she felt if he wasn&rsquo;t a
      little elevated she would very soon have an offer. Then Mammas, and Mrs.
      Rocket Larkspurs, and Mrs. Dotherington, and Mrs. Impelow, and many other
      quick-eyed ladies followed their movements, each thinking that they saw by
      the sparkle of Clara&rsquo;s eyes, and the slight flush of her pretty face, what
      was going on. But they were prématuré. Sir Moses did not offer until he
      had mopped his brow in the promenade, when, on making the second slow
      round of the room, a significant glance with a slight inclination of her
      handsome head as she passed her Mamma announced that she was going to be
      Lady Mainchance!

    </p>
    <p>
      Another offer and accepted say we. Captain and Mrs. Languisher, Sir Moses
      and Lady Mainchance. Who wouldn&rsquo;t go to a Hit-im-and-Hold-im-shire hunt
      ball?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then when the music struck up again, instead of fulfilling her engagements
      with her next partner. Clara begged to be excused&mdash;had got a little
      headache, and went and sat down between her Mamma and her admiring
      intended; upon which the smouldering fire of surmise broke out into
      downright assertion, and it ran through the room that Sir Moses had
      offered to Miss Yammerton. Then the indignant Mammas rose hastily from
      their seats and paraded slowly past, to see how the couple looked, pitying
      the poor creature, and young gentlemen joked with each other, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Go
      thou and do likewise.&rdquo; and paired off to the supper room to acquire
      courage from the well iced but inferior Champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the ardent ball progressed, some laying the foundations for future
      offers, some advancing their suits a step, others bringing them to we
      hope, a happy termination. Never was a more productive hunt ball known,
      and it was calculated that the little gentleman who rides so complacently
      on our first page exhausted all his arrows o the occasion.

    <p>
      When the mortified Miss de Glancey returned to her lodgings at Mrs.
      Sarsnet the milliner&rsquo;s, in Verbena Crescent, she bid Mrs. Roseworth
      good-night, and dismissing her little French maid to bed, proceeded to her
      own apartment, where, with the united aid of a chamber and two
      toilette-table candles, she instituted a most rigid examination, as well
      of her features as her figure, in her own hand-mirror and the various
      glasses of the room, and satisfied herself that neither her looks nor her
      dress were any way in fault for the indifference with which she had been
      received. Indeed, though she might perhaps be a little partial, she
      thought she never saw herself looking better, and certainly her dress was
      as stylish and looming as any in the ball-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those points being satisfactorily settled, she next unclasped the single
      row of large pearls that fastened the bunch of scarlet geraniums into her
      silken brown hair; and taking them off her exquisitely modelled head, laid
      them beside her massive scarlet geranium bouquet and delicate kid gloves
      upon the toilette-table. She then stirred the fire; and wheeling the
      easy-chair round to the front of it, took the eight hundred yards of tulle
      deliberately in either hand and sunk despondingly into the depths of the
      chair, with its ample folds before her. Drawing her dress up a little in
      front, she placed her taper white-satined feet on the low green fender,
      and burying her beautiful face in her lace-fringed kerchief, proceeded to
      take an undisturbed examination of what had occurred. How was it that she,
      in the full bloom of her beauty and the zenith of her experience, had
      failed in accomplishing what she used so easily to perform? How was it
      that Captain Langnisher seemed so cool, and that supercilious Miss eyed
      her with a side-long stare, that left its troubled mark behind, like the
      ripple of the water after a boat. And that boy Pringle, too, who ought to
      have been proud and flattered by her notice, instead of grinning about
      with those common country Misses?
    </p>
    <p>
      All this hurt and distressed our accomplished coquette, who was unused to
      indifference and mortification. Then from the present her mind reverted to
      the past; aud stirring the fire, she recalled the glorious recollections
      of her many triumphs, beginning with her school-girl days, when the
      yeomanry officers used to smile at her as they met the girls out walking,
      until Miss Whippey restricted them to the garden during the eight days
      that the dangerous danglers were on duty. Next, how the triumph of her
      first offer was enhanced by the fact that she got her old opponent Sarah
      Snowball&rsquo;s lover from her&mdash;who, however, she quickly discarded for
      Captain Capers&mdash;who in turn yielded to Major Spankley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dicer, and the grave Mr. Woodhouse all in tow together, each thinking
      himself the happy man and the others the cat&rsquo;s-paw, until the rash Hotspur
      Smith exploded amongst them, and then suddenly dwindled from a millionaire
      into a mouse. Other names quickly followed, recalling the recollections of
      a successful career. At last she came to that dread, that fatal day, when,
      having exterminated Imperial John, and with the Peer well in hand, she was
      induced, much against her better judgment, to continue the chase, and lose
      all chance of becoming a Countess. Oh, what a day was that! She had long
      watched the noble Earl&rsquo;s increasing fervour, and marked his admiring eye,
      as she sat in the glow of beauty and the pride of equestrianism; and she
      felt quite sure, if the chase had ended at the check caused by the
      cattle-drover&rsquo;s dog, he would have married her. Oh, that the run should
      ever have continued! Oh, that she should ever have been lured on to her
      certain destruction! Why didn&rsquo;t she leave well alone? And at the
      recollection of that sad, that watery day, she burst into tears and sobbed
      convulsively. Her feelings being thus relieved, and the fire about
      exhausted, she then got out of her crinoline and under the counterpane.

      summer-like throughout, changed to frost, binding all nature up in a few
      hours. The holes in the streets which were shining with water in the
      gas-lights when Miss de Glancey retired to bed, had a dull black-leaded
      sort of look in the morning, while the windows of her room glistened with
      the silvery spray of ferns and heaths and fancy flowers.&mdash;The air was

      and stare of the country town, determined to return by the 11.30 train; so
      arose after a restless night, and taking a hurried breakfast, proceeded,
      with the aid of her maid, to make one of those exquisite toilettes for
      which she had so long been justly famous. Her sylph-like figure was set
      off in a bright-green terry-velvet dress, with a green-feathered bonnet of
      the same colour and material, trimmed with bright scarlet ribbons, and a
      wreath of scarlet flowers inside.&mdash;A snow-white ermine tippet, with
      ermine cuffs and muff, completed her costume. Having surveyed herself in
      every mirror, she felt extremely satisfied, and only wished Captain
      Languisher could see her. With that exact punctuality which constant
      practice engenders, but which sometimes keeps strangers sadly on the fret,
      the useful fly was at length at the door, and the huge box containing the
      eight hundred yards of tulle being hoisted on to the iron-railed roof, the
      other articles were huddled away, and Miss de Glancey ascending the steps,
      usurped the seat of honour, leaving Mrs. Roseworth and her maid to sit
      opposite to her. A smile with a half-bow to Mrs. Sarsnet, as she now stood
      at the door, with a cut of the whip from the coachman, sent our party
      lilting and tilting over the hard surface of the road to the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The line ran true and smooth this day, and the snorting train stopped at
      the pretty Swiss cottage station at Fairfield just as Mrs. Roseworth saw
      the last of the parcels out of the fly, while Miss de Glancey took a
      furtive peek at the passengers from an angle of the bay window, at which
      she thought she herself could not be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it so happened that the train was in charge of the well-known Billy
      Bates, a smart young fellow, whose good looks had sadly stood in the way
      of his preferment, for he never could settle to anything; and after having
      been a footman, a whipper-in, a watcher, a groom, and a grocer, he had now
      taken up with the rail, where he was a great favourite with the fair, whom
      he rather prided himself upon pairing with what he considered appropriate
      partners. Seeing our lovely coquette peeping out, it immediately occurred
      to him, that he had a suitable <i>vis-à-vis</i> for her&mdash;a dashing
      looking gent., in a red flannel Emperor shirt, a blue satin cravat, a buff
      vest, aud a new bright-green cut-away with fancy buttons; altogether a
      sort of swell that isn&rsquo;t to be seen every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, ladies!&rdquo; now cried Billy, hurrying into the first-class
      waiting-room, adjusting the patent leather pouch-belt of his smart
      grcen-and-red uniform as he spoke. &ldquo;This way, ladies, please!&rdquo; waving them
      on with his clean white doeskin-gloved hand towards the door; whereupon
      Miss de Glancey, drawing herself up, and primming her features, advanced
      on to the platform, like the star of the evening coming on to the stage of
      a theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy then opened the frosty-windowed door of a carriage a few paces up
      the line; whereupon a red railway wrapper-rug with brown foxes&rsquo; heads
      being withdrawn, a pair of Bedford-corded legs dropped from the opposite
      seat, and a dogskin gloved hand was protruded to assist the ascent of the
      enterer. A pretty taper-fingered primrose-kidded one was presently inside
      it; but ere the second step was accomplished, a convulsive thrill was
      felt, and, looking up, Miss de Glancey found herself in the grasp of her
      old friend Imperial John!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mr. Hybrid!&rdquo; exclaimed she, shaking his still retained hand with the
      greatest cordiality; &ldquo;O Mr. Hybrid! I&rsquo;m so <i>glad</i> to see you! I&rsquo;m so
      <i>glad</i> to meet somebody I know!&rdquo; and gathering herself together, she
      entered the carriage, and sat down opposite him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Roseworth then following, afforded astonished John a moment to
      collect his scattered faculties, yet not sufficient time to compare the
      dread. &ldquo;<i>Si-r-r-r!</i> do you <i>mean to insult me!</i>&rdquo; of their former
      meeting, with the cordial greeting of this. Indeed, our fair friend felt
      that she had a great arrear of politeness to make up, and as railway time
      is short, she immediately began to ply her arts by inquiring most kindly
      after His Highness&rsquo;s sister Mrs. Poppeyfield and her baby, who she heard
      was <i>such</i> a sweet boy; and went on so affably, that before Billy
      Bates arrived with the tickets, which Mrs. Roseworth had forgotten to
      take, Imperial John began to think that there must have been some mistake
      before, and Miss de Glancey couldn&rsquo;t have understood him. Then, when the
      train was again in motion, she applied the artillery of her eyes so well&mdash;for
      she was as great an adept in her art as the Northumberland horse-tamer is
      in his&mdash;that ere they stopped at the Lanecroft station, she had again
      subjugated Imperial John;&mdash;taken his Imperial reason prisoner! Nay
      more, though he was going to Bowerbank to look at a bull, she actually
      persuaded him to alight and accompany her to Mrs. Roseworth&rsquo;s where we
      need scarcely say he was presently secured, and in less than a week she
      had him so tame that she could lead him about, anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the ball was always a busy one in Hit-im-and-Hold-em-shire.
      It was a sort of settling day, only the parties scattered about the
      country instead of congregating at the &ldquo;corner.&rdquo; Those who had made up
      their minds overnight, came to &ldquo;Ask Mamma&rdquo; in the morning, and those who
      had not mustered sufficient courage, tried what a visit to inquire how the
      young lady was after the fatigue of the ball would do to assist them.
      Those who had got so far on the road as to have asked both the young lady
      and &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; then got handed over to the more business-like inquiries of
      Papa&mdash;when Cupid oft &ldquo;spreads his light wings and in a moment flies.&rdquo;
       Then it is that the terrible money exaggerations come out&mdash;the great
      expectations dwindling away, and the thousands a-year becoming hundreds.
      We never knew a reputed Richest Commoner&rsquo;s fortune that didn&rsquo;t collapse
      most grievously under the &ldquo;what have you got, and what will you do?&rdquo;
       operation. But if it passes Papa, the still more dread ordeal of the
      lawyer has to be encountered when one being summoned on either side, a
      hard money-driving bargain ensues, one trying how much he can get, the
      other how little he can give&mdash;until the whole nature and character of
      the thing is changed. Money! money! money! is the cry, as if there was
      nothing in the world worth living for but those eternal bits of yellow
      coin. But we are getting in advance of our subject, our suitor not having
      passed the lower, or &ldquo;Ask-Mamma&rdquo; house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the many visited on this auspicious day were our fair friends at
      Yammerton Grange, our Richest Commoner having infused a considerable
      degree of activity into the matrimonial market. There is nothing like a
      little competition for putting young gentlemen on the alert. First to
      arrive was our friend Sir Moses Mainchance, who dashed up to the door in
      his gig with the air of a man on safe ground, saluting Mamma whom he found
      alone in the drawing-room, and then the young ladies as they severally
      entered in succession. Having thus sealed and delivered himself into the
      family, as it were, he enlarged on the delights of the ball&mdash;the
      charming scene, the delightful music, the excellent dancing, the sudden
      disappearance of de Glancey and other the incidents of the evening. These
      topics being duly discussed, and cake and wine produced, &ldquo;Mamma&rdquo; presently
      withdrew, her example being followed at intervals by Flora and Harriet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had she got clear of the door ere the vehement bark of the
      terrier called her attention to the front of the house, where she saw our
      fat friend the Woolpack tit-tup-ing up on the identical horse Jack Rogers
      so unceremoniously appropriated on the Crooked Billet day. There was young
      Treadcroft with his green-liveried cockaded groom behind him, trying to
      look as unconcerned as possible, though in reality he was in as great a
      fright as it was well possible for a boy to be. Having dismounted and
      nearly pulled the bell out of its socket with nervousness, he gave his
      horse to the groom, with orders to wait, and then followed the footman
      into the dining-room, whither Mrs. Yammerton had desired him to be shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Woolpack and the young Owl (Rowley Abingdon), had been very
      attentive both to Flora and Harriet at the ball, the Woolpack having twice
      had an offer on the tip of his tongue for Flora, without being able to get
      it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow his tongue clave to his lips&mdash;he felt as if his mouth was
      full of claggum. He now came to see if he could have any better luck at
      the Grange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Yammerton had read his feelings at the ball, and not receiving the
      expected announcement from Flora, saw that he wanted a little of her
      assistance, so now proceeded to give it. After a most cordial greeting and
      interchanges of the usual nothings of society, she took a glance at the
      ball, and then claimed his congratulations on Clara&rsquo;s engagement, which of
      course led up to the subject, opening the locked jaw at once; and Mamma
      having assured the fat youth of her perfect approval and high opinion of
      his character, very soon arranged matters between them, and produced Flora
      to confirm her. So she gained two sons-in-law in one night. Miss Harriet
      thus left alone, took her situation rather to heart, and fine Billy,
      forgetful of his Mamma&rsquo;s repeated injunctions and urgent entreaties to him
      to return now that the ball was over, and the hunting was stopped by the
      frost, telling him she wanted him on most urgent and particular business,
      was tender-hearted enough on finding Harriet in tears the next day to
      offer to console her with his hand, which we need not say she joyfully
      accepted, no lady liking to emulate &ldquo;the last rose of summer and be left
      blooming alone.&rdquo; So all the pretty sisters were suited, Harriet perhaps
      the best off, as far as looks at least went.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when in due course the old &ldquo;what have you got and what will you do?&rdquo;
       inquiries came to be instituted, we are sorry to say our fine friend could
      not answer them nearly so satisfactorily as the Woolpack, who had his
      balance-sheets nearly off by heart. Billy replying in the vacant <i>negligè</i>
      sort of way young gentlemen do, that he supposed he would have four or
      five thousand a-year, though when asked why he thought he&rsquo;d have four or
      five thousand a-year, he really could not tell the reason why. Then when
      further probed by our persevering Major, he admitted that it was all at
      the mercy of uncle Jerry, and that his Mamma had said their lawyer had
      told her he did not think pious Jerry would account except under pressure
      of the Court of Chancery, whereupon the Major&rsquo;s chin dropped, as many a
      man&rsquo;s chin has dropped, at the dread announcement. It sounds like an
      antidote to matrimony. Even Mrs. Yammerton thought under the circumstances
      that the young Owl might be a safer speculation than fine Billy, though
      she rather leant to fine Billy, as people do lean to strangers in
      preference to those they knew all about. Still Chancery was a choker.
      Equity is to the legal world what Newmarket is to the racing world, the
      unadulterated essence of the thing. As at Newmarket there is none of the
      fun and gaiety of the great race-meetings, so in Chancery there is none of
      the pomp and glitter and varied incident that rivets so many audiences to
      the law courts.
    </p>
    <p>
      All is dull, solemn, and dry&mdash;paper, paper, paper&mdash;a redundancy
      of paper, as if it were possible to transfer the blush of perjury to
      paper. Fifty people will make affidavits for one that will go into a
      witness-box and have the truth twisted out of them by cross-examination.
      The few strangers who pop into court pop out again as quickly as they can,
      a striking contrast to those who go in in search of their rights&mdash;though
      wrestling for one&rsquo;s rights under a pressure of paper, is very like
      swimming for one&rsquo;s life enveloped in a salmon-net. It is juries that give
      vitality to the administration of justice. A drowsy hum pervades the bar,
      well calculated for setting restless children to sleep, save when some
      such brawling buffoon as the Indian juggler gets up to pervert facts, and
      address arguments to an educated judge that would be an insult to the mind
      of a petty juryman. One wonders at men calling themselves gentlemen
      demeaning themselves by such practices. Well did the noble-hearted Sir
      William Erie declare that the licence of the bar was such that he often
      wished the offenders could be prosecuted for a misdemeanour. We know an
      author who made an affidavit in a chancery suit equal in length to a
      three-volume novel, and what with weighing every word in expectation of
      undergoing some of the polished razors keen of that drowsy bar, he could
      not write fiction again for a twelvemonth. As it was, he underwent that
      elegant extract Mr. Verde, whose sponsors have done him such justice in
      the vulgar tongue, and because he made an immaterial mistake he was held
      up to the Court as utterly unworthy of belief! We wonder whether Mr.
      Verde&rsquo;s character or the deponent&rsquo;s suffered most by the performance. But
      enough of such worthies. Let all the bullies of the bar bear in mind if
      they have tongues other people have pens, and that consideration for the
      feelings of others is one of the distinguishing characteristics of
      gentlemen.

    <p>
      HE proverbial serenity of Poodles was disturbed one dull winter afternoon
      by our old friend General Binks banging down the newly-arrived evening
      paper with a vehemence rarely witnessed in that quiet quarter. Mr.
      Dorfold, who was dosing as usual with outstretched leg&rsquo;s before the fire,
      started up, thinking the General was dying. Major Mustard&rsquo;s hat dropped
      off, Mr. Proser let fall the &ldquo;Times Supplement,&rdquo; Mr. Crowsfoot ceased
      conning the &ldquo;Post..&rdquo; Alemomh, the footman, stood aghast, and altogether
      there was a general cessation of every thing&mdash;Beedles was paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General quickly followed up the blow with a tremendous oath, and
      seizing Colonel Callender&rsquo;s old beaver hat instead of his own new silk
      one, flung frantically out of the room, through the passage and into St.
      James&rsquo;s Street, as if bent on immediate destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was amazement! What&rsquo;s happened the General? Something must have gone
      wrong with the General! The General&mdash;the calmest, the quietest, the
      most, placid man in the world&mdash;suddenly convulsed with such a violent
      paroxysm. He who had neither chick nor child, nor anything to care about,
      with the certainty of an Earldom, what <i>could</i> have come over him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Bullion who had just dropped in on his way
      from the City: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; repeated he. taking up the paper which the
      General had thrown down. &ldquo;<i>His bank&rsquo;s failed!</i> Heard some qweerish
      hints as I came down Cornhill:&rdquo; and forthwith! Bullion turned to the City
      article, and ran his accustomed eye down its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funds opened heavily. Foreign stocks quiet. About £20,000 in bar gold.
      The John Brown arrived from China. Departure of the Peninsular Mail
      postponed,&rdquo; and so on; but neither failures, nor rumours of failures,
      either of bankers or others, were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very odd&mdash;what could it be, then? must be something in the paper. And
      again the members resolved themselves into a committee of the whole house
      to ascertain what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first place that a lady would look to for the solution of a mystery of
      this sort, is, we believe, about the last place that a man would look to,
      namely, the births, deaths, and marriages; and it was not until the
      sensation had somewhat subsided, and Tommy White was talking of beating up
      the General&rsquo;s quarter in Bury Street, to hear what it was, that his
      inseparable&mdash;that &ldquo;nasty covetous body Cuddy Flintoff,&rdquo; who had been
      plodding very perseveringly on the line, at length hit off what astonished
      him as much as we have no doubt it will the reader, being neither more nor
      less than the following very quiet announcement at the end of the list of
      marriages:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning, at St. Barnabas, by the Rev. Dr. Duff, the Right Hon. The
      Earl of Ladythorne, to Emma, widow of the late Wm, Pringle, Esq.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Ladythorne married to Mrs. Pringle! Well done our fair friend
      of the frontispiece! The pure white camellias are succeeded by a coronet!
      The borrowed velvet dress replaced by anything she likes to own. Who would
      have thought it!
    </p>
    <p>
      But wonders will never cease; for on this eventful day Mr. George Gallon
      was seen driving the Countess&rsquo;s old coach companion, Mrs. Margerum, from
      Cockthorpe Church, with long white rosettes flying at Tippy Tom&rsquo;s head,
      and installing her mistress of the Rose and Crown, at the cross roads;
      thus showing that truth is stranger than fiction. &ldquo;George,&rdquo; we may add,
      has now taken the Flying Childers Inn at Eversley Green, where he purposes
      extending his &ldquo;Torf&rdquo; operations, and we make no doubt will be heard of
      hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of our other fair friends we must say a few parting words on taking a
      reluctant farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Miss Clara, now Lady Mainchance, is not quite so good a housekeeper
      as Sir Moses could have wished, she is nevertheless extremely ornamental
      at the head of his table; and though she has perhaps rather exceeded with
      Gillow, the Major promises to make it all right by his superior management
      of the property. Mr. Mordecai Nathan has been supplanted by our master of
      &ldquo;haryers,&rdquo; who has taken a drainage loan, and promises to set the
      water-works playing at Pangburn Park, just as he did at Yammerton Grange.
      He means to have a day a week there with his &ldquo;haryers,&rdquo; which, he says, is
      the best way of seeing a country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss de Glancey has revised Barley Hill Hall, for which place his Highness
      now appears in Burke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Landed Gentry,&rdquo; very considerably; and though she
      has not been to Gillow, she has got the plate out of the drawing-room, and
      made things very smart. She keeps John in excellent order, and rides his
      grey horse admirably. Blurkins says &ldquo;the grey mare is the better horse,&rdquo;
       but that is no business of ours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of all the brides, perhaps, Miss Flora got the best set down; for the
      Woolpack&rsquo;s house was capitally furnished, and he is far happier driving
      his pretty wife about the country with a pair of pyebald ponies, making
      calls, than in risking his neck across country with hounds&mdash;or rather
      after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all our beauties, and thanks to Leech we have dealt in nothing else,
      Miss Harriet alone remains unsettled with her two strings to her bow&mdash;fine
      Billy and Rowley Abingdon; though which is to be the happy man remains to
      be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      We confess we incline to think that the Countess will be too many for the
      Yammertons; but if she is, there is no great harm done; for Harriet is
      very young, and the Owl is a safe card in the country where men are more
      faithful than they are in the towns. Indeed, fine Billy is almost too
      young to know his own mind, and marrying now would only perhaps involve
      the old difficulty hereafter of father and son wanting top boots at the
      same time, supposing our friend to accomplish the difficult art of sitting
      at the Jumps.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let us leave our hero open. And as we have only aimed at nothing but
      the natural throughout, we will finish by proposing a toast that will
      include as well the mated and the single of our story, as the mated and
      the single all the world over, namely, the old and popular one of &ldquo;The
      single married, and the married happy!&rdquo; drunk with three times three and
      one cheer more! HOO-RAY!
    </p>
